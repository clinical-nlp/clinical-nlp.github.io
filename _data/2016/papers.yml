- abstract: 'Importance of utilizing medical information is getting increased as electronic

    health records (EHRs) are widely used nowadays. We aim to assign international

    standardized disease codes, ICD-10, to Japanese textual information in EHRs for

    users to reuse the information accurately. In this paper, we propose methods to

    automatically extract diagnosis and to assign ICD codes to Japanese medical

    records. Due to the lack of available training data, we dare employed

    rule-based methods rather than machine learning. We observed characteristics of

    medical records carefully, writing rules to make effective methods by hand. We

    applied our system to the NTCIR-12 MedNLPDoc shared task data where

    participants are required to assign ICD-10 codes of possible diagnosis in given

    EHRs. In this shared task, our system achieved the highest F-measure score

    among all participants in the most severe evaluation criteria. Through

    comparison with other approaches, we show that our approach could be a useful

    milestone for the future development of Japanese medical record processing.'

  title: Inference of ICD Codes from Japanese Medical Records by Searching Disease Names
- abstract: 'In this work we present a fine-grained annotation schema to detect named

    entities in German clinical data of chronically ill patients with kidney

    diseases. The annotation schema is driven by the needs of our clinical partners

    and the linguistic aspects of German language. In order to generate annotations

    within a short period, the work also presents a semi-automatic annotation which

    uses additional sources of knowledge such as UMLS, to pre-annotate concepts in

    advance. The presented schema will be used to apply novel techniques from

    natural language processing and machine learning to support doctors treating

    their patients by improved information access from unstructured German texts.'

  title: A fine-grained corpus annotation schema of German nephrology records
- abstract: 'The goal of this paper is to examine the impact of simple feature engineering

    mechanisms before applying more sophisticated techniques to the task of medical

    NER. Sometimes papers using scientifically sound techniques present raw

    baselines that could be improved adding simple and cheap features. This work

    focuses on entity recognition for the clinical domain for three languages:

    English, Swedish and Spanish. The task is tackled using simple features,

    starting from the window size, capitalization, prefixes, and moving to POS and

    semantic tags. This work demonstrates that a simple initial step of feature

    engineering can improve the baseline results significantly. Hence, the

    contributions of this paper are: first, a short list of guidelines well

    supported with experimental results on three languages and, second, a detailed

    description of the relevance of these features for medical NER.'

  title: The impact of simple feature engineering in multilingual medical NER
- abstract: 'In recent years, detecting Alzheimer disease (AD) in early stages based on

    natural language processing (NLP) has drawn much attention. To date, vocabulary

    size, grammatical complexity, and fluency have been studied using NLP metrics.

    However, the content analysis of AD narratives is still unreachable for NLP.

    This study investigates features of the words that AD patients use in their

    spoken language. After recruiting 18 examinees of 53–90 years old (mean:

    76.89), they were divided into two groups based on MMSE scores. The AD group

    comprised 9 examinees with scores of 21 or lower. The healthy control group

    comprised 9 examinees with a score of 22 or higher. Linguistic Inquiry and Word

    Count (LIWC) classified words were used to categorize the words that the

    examinees used. The word frequency was found from observation. Significant

    differences were confirmed for the usage of impersonal pronouns in the AD

    group. This result demonstrated the basic feasibility of the proposed NLP-based

    detection

    approach.'

  title: Detecting Japanese Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease based on Word Category Frequencies
- abstract: 'Automated extraction of concepts from patient clinical records is an essential

    facilitator of clinical research. For this reason, the 2010 i2b2/VA Natural

    Language

    Processing Challenges for Clinical Records introduced a concept extraction task

    aimed at identifying and classifying concepts into predefined categories (i.e.,

    treatments, tests and problems). State-of-the-art concept extraction approaches

    heavily rely on handcrafted features and domain-specific resources which are

    hard to collect and define. For this reason, this paper proposes an

    alternative, streamlined approach: a recurrent neural network (the

    bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding) initialized with general-purpose,

    off-the-shelf word embeddings. The experimental results achieved on the 2010

    i2b2/VA reference corpora using the proposed framework outperform all recent

    methods and ranks closely to the best submission from the original 2010 i2b2/VA

    challenge.'

  title: 'MedNLPDoc: Japanese Shared Task for Clinical NLP'
- abstract: 'Rapid growth in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) has emerged to an expansion of

    data in the

    clinical domain. The majority of the available health care information is

    sealed in the form of narrative

    documents which form the rich source of clinical information. Text mining of

    such clinical

    records has gained huge attention in various medical applications like

    treatment and decision making.

    However, medical records enclose patient Private Health Information (PHI) which

    can

    reveal the identities of the patients. In order to retain the privacy of

    patients, it is mandatory to remove

    all the PHI information prior to making it publicly available. The aim is to

    de-identify or

    encrypt the PHI from the patient medical records. In this paper, we propose an

    algorithm based

    on deep learning architecture to solve this problem. We perform

    de-identification of seven PHI

    terms from the clinical records. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that

    our proposed

    approach achieves encouraging performance, which is better than the baseline

    model developed

    with Conditional Random Field.'

  title: Prediction of Key Patient Outcome from Sentence and Word of Medical Text Records
- abstract: 'Clinical narratives in electronic health record systems are a rich resource of

    patient-based information. They constitute an ongoing challenge for natural

    language processing, due to their high compactness and abundance of short

    forms. German medical texts exhibit numerous ad-hoc abbreviations that

    terminate with a period character. The disambiguation of period characters is

    therefore an important task for sentence and abbreviation detection. This task

    is addressed by a combination of co-occurrence information of word types with

    trailing period characters, a large domain dictionary, and a simple rule

    engine, thus merging statistical and dictionary-based disambiguation

    strategies. An F-measure of 0.95 could be reached by using the unsupervised

    approach presented in this paper. The results are promising for a

    domain-independent abbreviation detection strategy, because our approach avoids

    retraining of models or use case specific feature engineering efforts required

    for supervised machine learning approaches.'

  title: Semi-supervised Clustering of Medical Text
- abstract: 'Paraphrase generation is important in various applications such as search,

    summarization, and question answering due to its ability to generate textual

    alternatives while keeping the overall meaning intact. Clinical paraphrase

    generation is especially vital in building patient-centric clinical decision

    support (CDS) applications where users are able to understand complex clinical

    jargons via easily comprehensible alternative paraphrases. This paper presents

    Neural Clinical Paraphrase Generation (NCPG), a novel approach that casts the

    task as a monolingual neural machine translation (NMT) problem. We propose an

    end-to-end neural network built on an attention-based bidirectional Recurrent

    Neural Network (RNN) architecture with an encoder-decoder framework to perform

    the task. Conventional bilingual NMT models mostly rely on word-level modeling

    and are often limited by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues. In contrast, we

    represent the source and target paraphrase pairs as character sequences to

    address this limitation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work

    that uses attention-based RNNs for clinical paraphrase generation and also

    proposes an end-to-end character-level modeling for this task. Extensive

    experiments on a large curated clinical paraphrase corpus show that the

    attention-based NCPG models achieve improvements of up to 5.2 BLEU points and

    0.5 METEOR points over a non-attention based strong baseline for word-level

    modeling, whereas further gains of up to 6.1 BLEU points and 1.3 METEOR points

    are obtained by the character-level NCPG models over their word-level

    counterparts. Overall, our models demonstrate comparable performance relative

    to the state-of-the-art phrase-based non-neural models.'

  title: Neural Clinical Paraphrase Generation with Attention
- abstract: 'Patient notes contain a wealth of information of potentially great interest to

    medical investigators. However, to protect patients'' privacy, Protected Health

    Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they can be

    legally released, a process known as patient note de-identification. The main

    objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possible

    recall. Recently, the first neural-network-based de-identification system has

    been proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it does

    not rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed,

    but does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic health

    records (EHRs). In this work, we explore a method to incorporate

    human-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to a

    neural-network-based de-identification system. Our results show that the

    addition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves the

    state-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of the

    most sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life setting

    patient notes typically come with EHRs, we recommend developers of

    de-identification systems to leverage the information EHRs contain.'

  title: Feature-Augmented Neural Networks for Patient Note De-identification
- abstract: 'The issue of privacy has always been a concern when clinical texts are used for

    research purposes. Personal health information (PHI) (such as name and

    identification number) needs to be removed so that patients cannot be

    identified. Manual anonymization is not feasible due to the large number of

    clinical texts to be anonymized. In this paper, we tackle the task of

    anonymizing clinical texts written in sentence fragments and which frequently

    contain symbols, abbreviations, and misspelled words. Our clinical texts

    therefore differ from those in the i2b2 shared tasks which are in prose form

    with complete sentences. Our clinical texts are also part of a structured

    database which contains patient name and identification number in structured

    fields. As such, we formulate our anonymization task as spelling variant

    detection, exploiting patients'' personal information in the structured fields

    to detect their spelling variants in clinical texts. We successfully anonymized

    clinical texts consisting of more than 200 million words, using minimum edit

    distance and regular expression patterns.'

  title: Automated Anonymization as Spelling Variant Detection
- abstract: "The proliferation of deep learning methods in natural language processing (NLP)\nand the large amounts of data they often require stands in stark contrast to\nthe relatively data-poor clinical NLP domain. In particular, large text corpora\nare necessary to build high-quality word embeddings, yet often large corpora\nthat are suitably representative of the target clinical data are unavailable. \nThis forces a choice between building embeddings from small clinical corpora\nand less representative, larger corpora. This paper explores this trade-off, as\nwell as intermediate compromise solutions. Two standard clinical NLP tasks (the\ni2b2 2010 concept and assertion tasks) are evaluated with commonly used deep\nlearning models (recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks)\nusing a set of six corpora ranging from the target i2b2 data to large\nopen-domain datasets. While combinations of corpora are generally found to work\nbest, the single-best corpus is generally task-dependent."
