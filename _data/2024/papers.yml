- abstract: 'Summarizing medical conversations poses unique challenges due to the
    specialized domain and the difficulty of collecting in-domain training data. In
    this study, we investigate the performance of state-of-the-art doctor-patient
    conversation generative summarization models on the out-of-domain data. We divide
    the summarization model of doctor-patient conversation into two configurations:
    (1) a general model, without specifying subjective (S), objective (O), and assessment
    (A) and plan (P) notes; (2) a SOAP-oriented model that generates a summary with
    SOAP sections. We analyzed the limitations and strengths of the fine-tuning language
    model-based methods and GPTs on both configurations. We also conducted a Linguistic
    Inquiry and Word Count analysis to compare the SOAP notes from different datasets.
    The results exhibit a strong correlation for reference notes across different
    datasets, indicating that format mismatch (i.e., discrepancies in word distribution)
    is not the main cause of performance decline on out-of-domain data. Lastly, a
    detailed analysis of SOAP notes is included to provide insights into missing information
    and hallucinations introduced by the models.'

  title: 'Exploring Robustness in Doctor-Patient Conversation Summarization: An Analysis
    of Out-of-Domain SOAP Notes'
- abstract: 'In the expanding field of language model applications, medical knowledge
    representation remains a significant challenge due to the specialized nature of
    the domain. Large language models, such as GPT-4, obtain reasonable scores on
    medical question-answering tasks, but smaller models are far behind.

    In this work, we introduce a method to improve the proficiency of a small language
    model in the medical domain by employing a two-fold approach. We first fine-tune
    the model on a corpus of medical textbooks. Then, we use GPT-4 to generate questions
    similar to the downstream task, prompted with textbook knowledge, and use them
    to fine-tune the model. Additionally, we introduce ECN-QA, a novel Medical QA
    dataset containing ``progressive questions'''' composed of related sequential
    questions. We show the benefits of our training strategy on this dataset.

    The study''s findings highlight the potential of small language models in the
    medical domain when appropriately fine-tuned.'

  title: Efficient Medical Question Answering with Knowledge-Augmented Question Generation
- abstract: "Large language models have the potential to be valuable in the healthcare\
    \ industry, but it's crucial to verify their safety and effectiveness through\
    \ rigorous evaluation. In our study, we evaluated LLMs, including Google's Gemini,\
    \ across various medical tasks. Despite Gemini's capabilities, it underperformed\
    \ compared to leading models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4, particularly in medical\
    \ visual question answering (VQA), with a notable accuracy gap (Gemini at 61.45%\
    \ vs. GPT-4V at 88%). \n\nOur analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible\
    \ to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks\
    \ if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject\
    \ and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians.\
    \  To mitigate risks, we implemented effective prompting strategies, improving\
    \ performance, and contributed to the field by releasing a Python module for medical\
    \ LLM evaluation and establishing a leaderboard on Hugging Face for ongoing research\
    \ and development. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval"

    Language Models on Medical Challenge Problems & Hallucinations'
- abstract: "Electronic health records (EHR) and claims data are rich sources of real-world\
    \ data that reflect patient health status and healthcare utilization. \nQuerying\
    \ these databases to answer epidemiological questions is challenging due to the\

    \ coding step into the text-to-SQL process, significantly improves the performance\
    \ over simple prompting. Our findings indicate that although current language\
    \ models are not yet sufficiently accurate for unsupervised use, RAG offers a\
    \ promising direction for improving their capabilities, as shown in a realistic\

  title: 'ClinicalMamba: A Generative Clinical Language Model on Longitudinal Clinical
    Notes'
- abstract: As a predictive measure of the treatment outcome in psychotherapy, the
    working alliance measures the agreement of the patient and the therapist in terms
    of their bond, task and goal. Long been a clinical quantity estimated by the patients'
    and therapists' self-evaluative reports, we believe that the working alliance
    can be better characterized using natural language processing technique directly
    in the dialogue transcribed in each therapy session. In this work, we propose
    the Working Alliance Transformer (WAT), a Transformer-based classification model
    that has a psychological state encoder which infers the working alliance scores
    by projecting the embedding of the dialogues turns onto the embedding space of
    the clinical inventory for working alliance. We evaluate our method in a real-world
    dataset with over 950 therapy sessions with anxiety, depression, schizophrenia
    and suicidal patients and demonstrate an empirical advantage of using information
    about therapeutic states in the sequence classification task of psychotherapy
    dialogues.

  title: Working Alliance Transformer for Psychotherapy Dialogue Classification
- abstract: Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential for extracting important
    medical insights from clinical narratives. Given the challenges in obtaining expert
    training datasets for real-world clinical applications related to data protection
    regulations and the lack of standardised entity types, this work represents a
    collaborative initiative aimed at building a German clinical NER system with a
    focus on addressing these obstacles effectively. In response to the challenge
    of training data scarcity, we propose a Conditional Relevance Learning (CRL) approach
    in low-resource transfer learning scenarios. CRL effectively leverages a pre-trained
    language model and domain-specific open resources, enabling the acquisition of
    a robust base model tailored for clinical NER tasks, particularly in the face
    of changing label sets. This flexibility empowers the implementation of a Multilayered
    Semantic Annotation (MSA) schema in our NER system, capable of organizing a diverse
    array of entity types, thus significantly boosting the NER system's adaptability
    and utility across various clinical domains. In the case study, we demonstrate
    how our NER system can be applied to overcome resource constraints and comply
    with data privacy regulations. Lacking prior training on in-domain data, feedback
    from expert users in respective domains is essential in identifying areas for
    system refinement. Future work will focus on the integration of expert feedback
    to improve system performance in specific clinical contexts.

  title: Building A German Clinical Named Entity Recognition System without In-domain
    Training Data
- abstract: "Automatic depression detection from conversational data has gained significant\
    \ interest in recent years.\nThe DAIC-WOZ dataset, interviews conducted by a human-controlled\
    \ virtual agent, has been widely used for this task.\nRecent studies have reported\
    \ enhanced performance when incorporating interviewer's prompts into the model.\n\
    In this work, we hypothesize that this improvement might be mainly due to a bias\
    \ present in these prompts, rather than the proposed architectures and methods.\n\
    Through ablation experiments and qualitative analysis, we discover that models\
    \ using interviewer's prompts learn to focus on a specific region of the interviews,\
    \ where questions about past experiences with mental health issues are asked,\
    \ and use them as discriminative shortcuts to detect depressed participants. \n\
    In contrast, models using participant responses gather evidence from across the\
    \ entire interview.\nFinally, to highlight the magnitude of this bias, we achieve\
    \ a 0.90 F1 score by intentionally exploiting it, the highest result reported\
    \ to date on this dataset using only textual information.\nOur findings underline\
    \ the need for caution when incorporating interviewers' prompts into models, as\
    \ they may inadvertently learn to exploit targeted prompts, rather than learning\
    \ to characterize the language and behavior that are genuinely indicative of the\
    \ patient's mental health condition."

  title: 'DAIC-WOZ: On the Validity of Using the Therapist''s prompts in Automatic
    Depression Detection from Clinical Interviews'
- abstract: Adapting pretrained language models to novel domains, such as clinical
    applications, traditionally involves retraining their entire set of parameters.
    Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques for fine-tuning language models
    significantly reduce computational requirements by selectively fine-tuning small
    subsets of parameters.  In this study, we propose a two-step PEFT framework and
    evaluate it in the clinical domain. Our approach combines a specialised PEFT adapter
    layer designed for clinical domain adaptation with another adapter specialised
    for downstream tasks. We evaluate the framework on multiple clinical outcome prediction
    datasets, comparing it to clinically trained language models. Our framework achieves
    a better AUROC score averaged across all clinical downstream tasks compared to
    clinical language models. In particular, we observe large improvements of 4-5\%
    AUROC in large-scale multilabel classification tasks, such as diagnoses and procedures
    classification. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide an extensive
    empirical analysis of the interplay between PEFT techniques and domain adaptation
    in an important real-world domain of clinical applications.

  title: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLaMA for the Clinical Domain
- abstract: 'Biomedical NLP models play a big role in the automatic extraction of
    information from biomedical documents, such as COVID research papers. Three landmark
    models have led the way in this area: BioBERT, MSR BiomedBERT, and BioLinkBERT.
    However, their shallow evaluation ‚Äìa single mean score‚Äì forbid us to better understand
    how the contributions proposed in each model advance the Biomedical NLP field.
    We show through a Multilevel Analysis how we can assess these contributions. Our
    analyses across 5000 fine-tuned models show that, actually, BiomedBERT‚Äôs true
    effect is bigger than BioLinkBERT‚Äôs effect, and the success of BioLinkBERT does
    not seem to be due to its contribution ‚Äìthe Link function‚Äì but due to an unknown
    factor.'

  title: A Multilevel Analysis of PubMed-only BERT-based Biomedical Models
- abstract: Annotated corpora are essential to reliable natural language processing.
    While they are expensive to create, they are essential for building and evaluating
    systems. This study introduces a new corpus of 2,869 medical and admission reports
    collected by an occupational insurance and health provider. The corpus has been
    carefully annotated for personally identifiable information (PII) and is shared,
    masking this information. Two annotators adhered to annotation guidelines during
    the annotation process, and a referee later resolved annotation conflicts in a
    consolidation process to build a gold standard subcorpus. The inter-annotator
    agreement values, measured in F1, range between 0.86 and 0.93 depending on the
    selected subcorpus. The value of the corpus is demonstrated by evaluating its
    use for NER of PII and a classification task. The evaluations find that fine-tuned
    models and GPT-3.5 reach F1 of 0.911 and 0.720 in NER of PII, respectively. In
    the case of the insurance coverage classification task, using the original or
    de-identified corpus results in similar performance. The annotated data are released
    in de-identified form.

  title: 'A Privacy-Preserving Corpus for Occupational Health in Spanish: Evaluation
    for NER and Classification Tasks'
- abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as valuable tools for many
    natural language understanding tasks. In safety-critical applications such as
    healthcare, the utility of these models is governed by their ability to generate
    factually accurate and complete outputs. In this work, we present dialog-enabled
    resolving agents (DERA). DERA is a paradigm made possible by the increased conversational
    abilities of LLMs.  It provides a simple, interpretable forum for models to communicate
    feedback and iteratively improve output. We frame our dialog as a discussion between
    two agent types -- a Researcher, who processes information and identifies crucial
    problem components, and a Decider, who has the autonomy to integrate the Researcher''s
    information and makes judgments on the final output.


    We test DERA against three clinically-focused tasks, with GPT-4 serving as our
    LLM. DERA shows significant improvement over the base GPT-4 performance in both
    human expert preference evaluations and quantitative metrics for medical conversation
    summarization and care plan generation. In a new finding, we also show that GPT-4''s
    performance (70%) on an open-ended version of the MedQA question-answering (QA)
    dataset (Jin 2021; USMLE) is well above the passing level (60%), with DERA showing
    similar performance. We will release the open-ended MedQA dataset.'

  title: 'DERA: Enhancing Large Language Model Completions with  Dialog-Enabled Resolving
    Agents'
- abstract: Information extraction from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial
    task in healthcare, and the lack of resources and language specificity pose significant
    challenges. This study addresses the limited availability of Italian Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) tools for clinical applications and the computational demand
    of large language models (LLMs) for training. We present LlamaMTS, an instruction-tuned
    Llama for the Italian language, leveraging the LoRA technique. It is ensembled
    with a BERT-based model to classify EHRs based on the presence or absence of metastasis
    in patients affected by Breast cancer. Through our evaluation analysis, we discovered
    that LlamaMTS exhibits superior performance compared to both zero-shot LLMs and
    other Italian BERT-based models specifically fine-tuned on the same metastatic
    task. LlamaMTS demonstrates promising results in resource-constrained environments,
    offering a practical solution for information extraction from Italian EHRs in
    oncology, potentially improving patient care and outcomes.

  title: 'LlamaMTS: Optimizing Metastasis Detection with Llama Instruction Tuning
    and BERT-Based Ensemble in Italian Clinical Reports'
- abstract: 'Text generation opens up new prospects for overcoming the lack of open
    corpora in fields such as healthcare, where data sharing is bound by confidentiality.
    In this study, we compare the performance of encoder-decoder and decoder-only
    language models for the controlled generation of clinical cases in French. To
    do so, we fine-tuned several pre-trained models on French clinical cases for each
    architecture and generate clinical cases conditioned by patient demographic information
    (gender and age) and clinical features.

    Our results suggest that encoder-decoder models are easier to control than decoder-only
    models, but more costly to train.'

  title: Using Structured Health Information for Controlled Generation of Clinical
    Cases in French
- abstract: This study evaluates the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
    accurately labeling clinical document excerpts. Our focus is on the assignment
    of potential or confirmed diagnoses and medical procedures to snippets of medical
    text sourced from unstructured clinical patient records. We explore how the performance
    of LLMs compare against human annotators in classifying these excerpts. Employing
    a few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting approach with the MIMIC-III dataset, Med-PaLM
    2 showcases annotation accuracy comparable to human annotators, achieving a notable
    precision rate of approximately 92\% relative to the gold standard labels established
    by human experts.

  title: Large Language Models Provide Human-Level Medical Text Snippet Labeling
- abstract: Given the increasing demand for mental health assistance, artificial intelligence
    (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), may be valuable for integration
    into automated clinical support systems. In this work, we leverage a decision
    transformer architecture for topic recommendation in counseling conversations
    between patients and mental health professionals. The architecture is utilized
    for  offline reinforcement learning, and we extract states (dialogue turn embeddings),
    actions (conversation topics), and rewards (scores measuring the alignment between
    patient and therapist) from previous turns within a conversation to train a decision
    transformer model. We demonstrate an improvement over baseline reinforcement learning
    methods, and propose a novel system of utilizing our model's output as synthetic
    labels for fine-tuning a large language model for the same task. Although our
    implementation based on LLaMA-2 7B has mixed results, future work can undoubtedly
    build on the design.

    a further contribution, we adapt several existing approaches for use in the German
    BEL setup, and report on their results. The chosen methods include a sparse model
    using character n-grams, a multilingual biomedical entity linker, and two general-purpose
    text retrieval models. Our results show that a language-specific KB that provides
    good coverage leads to most improvement in entity linking performance, irrespective
    of the used model. The finetuned German BEL model, newly created UMLS$_{Wikidata}$
    KB as well as the code to reproduce our results are publicly available.'

  title: 'Leveraging Wikidata for Biomedical Entity Linking in a Low-Resource Setting:
    A Case Study for German'
- abstract: "Clinical Decision Support Systems assist medical professionals in providing\
    \ optimal care for patients.\nA prominent data source used for creating tasks\
    \ for such systems is the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC).\n\
    MIMIC contains electronic health records (EHR) gathered in a tertiary hospital\
    \ in the United States.\nThe majority of past work is based on the third version\
    \ of MIMIC, although the fourth is the most recent version.\nThis new version,\
    \ not only introduces more data into MIMIC, but also increases the variety of\
    \ patients.\nWhile MIMIC-III is limited to intensive care units, MIMIC-IV also\
    \ offers EHRs from the emergency department.\nIn this work, we investigate how\
    \ to adapt previous work to update clinical outcome prediction for MIMIC-IV.\n\
    We revisit several established tasks, including prediction of diagnoses, procedures,\
    \ length-of-stay, and also introduce a novel task: patient routing prediction.\n\
    Furthermore, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate all tasks on several\
    \ bio-medical transformer encoder models.\nFinally, we provide narratives for\
    \ future research directions in the clinical outcome prediction domain.\n We make\
    \ our source code publicly available to reproduce our experiments, data, and tasks."

  title: Revisiting Clinical Outcome Prediction for MIMIC-IV
- abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist and
    potentially correct physicians in medical decision-making tasks. We evaluate several
    LLMs, including Meditron, Llama2, and Mistral, to analyze the ability of these
    models to interact effectively with physicians across different scenarios. We
    consider questions from PubMedQA and several tasks, ranging from binary (yes/no)
    responses to long answer generation, where the answer of the model is produced
    after an interaction with a physician. Our findings suggest that prompt design
    significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide
    valuable feedback to physicians, challenging incorrect diagnoses and contributing
    to more accurate decision-making. For example, when the physician is accurate
    38% of the time, Mistral can produce the correct answer, improving accuracy up
    to 74% depending on the prompt being used, while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit
    greater sensitivity to prompt choice. Our analysis also uncovers the challenges
    of ensuring that LLM-generated suggestions are pertinent and useful, emphasizing
    the need for further research in this area.

  title: Can LLMs Correct Physicians, Yet? Investigating Effective Interaction Methods
    in the Medical Domain
- abstract: We explore the utility of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) in
    detecting the presence, subtypes, and severity of aphasia across English and Mandarin
    Chinese speakers. Our investigation suggests that even without fine-tuning or
    domain-specific training, pre-trained LLMs can offer some insights on language
    disorders, regardless of speakers' first language. Our analysis also reveals noticeable
    differences between English and Chinese LLMs. While the English LLMs exhibit near-chance
    level accuracy in subtyping aphasia, the Chinese counterparts demonstrate less
    than satisfactory performance in distinguishing between individuals with and without
    aphasia. This research advocates for the importance of linguistically tailored
    and specified approaches in leveraging LLMs for clinical applications, especially
    in the context of multilingual populations.

  title: Leveraging pre-trained large language models for aphasia detection in English
    and Chinese speakers
- abstract: Vision-language models, while effective in general domains and showing
    strong performance in diverse multi-modal applications like visual question-answering
    (VQA), struggle to maintain the same level of effectiveness in more specialized
    domains, e.g., medical. We propose a medical vision-language model that integrates
    large vision and language models adapted for the medical domain. This model goes
    through three stages of parameter-efficient training using three separate biomedical
    and radiology multi-modal visual and text datasets. The proposed model achieves
    state-of-the-art performance on the SLAKE 1.0 medical VQA (MedVQA) dataset with
    an overall accuracy of 87.5% and demonstrates strong performance on another MedVQA
    dataset, VQA-RAD, achieving an overall accuracy of 73.2%.

  title: Fusion of Domain-Adapted Vision and Language Models for Medical Visual Question
    Answering
- abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) even though a boon for healthcare practitioners,
    are grow- ing convoluted and longer every day. Sifting around these lengthy EHRs
    is taxing and be- comes a cumbersome part of physician-patient interaction. Several
    approaches have been pro- posed to help alleviate this prevalent issue ei- ther
    via summarization or sectioning, however, only a few approaches have truly been
    helpful in the past. With the rise of automated methods, machine learning (ML)
    has shown promise in solving the task of identifying relevant sections in EHR.
    However, most ML methods rely on labeled data which is difficult to get in health-
    care. Large language models (LLMs) on the other hand, have performed impressive
    feats in natural language processing (NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e.
    without any labeled data. To that end, we propose using LLMs to identify relevant
    section headers. We find that GPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero
    and few-shot settings as well as segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art
    meth- ods. Additionally, we also annotate a much harder real world dataset and
    find that GPT-4 struggles to perform well, alluding to further research and harder
    benchmarks.

  title: LLM-Based Section Identifiers Excel on Open Source but Stumble in Real World
    Applications
- abstract: This paper is dedicated to the design and evaluation of the first AMR
    parser tailored for clinical notes. Our objective was to facilitate the precise
    transformation of the clinical notes into structured AMR expressions, thereby
    enhancing the interpretability and usability of clinical text data at scale. Leveraging
    the colon cancer dataset from the Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME)
    corpus, we adapted a state-of-the-art AMR parser utilizing continuous training.
    Our approach incorporates data augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy
    of AMR structure predictions. Notably, through this learning strategy, our parser
    achieved an impressive F1 score of 88\% on the THYME corpus's colon cancer dataset.
    Moreover, our research delved into the efficacy of data required for domain adaptation
    within the realm of clinical notes, presenting domain adaptation data requirements
    for AMR parsing. This exploration not only underscores the parser's robust performance
    but also highlights its potential in facilitating a deeper understanding of clinical
    narratives through structured semantic representations.

  title: Adapting Abstract Meaning Representation Parsing to the Clinical Narrative
    ‚Äì the SPRING THYME parser
- abstract: Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large
    Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent radiological
    reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that
    don‚Äôt accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel
    strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision
    Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining
    mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that
    leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations
    of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling
    objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize
    and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image
    and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing
    nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as
    LlaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology
    Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy
    images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards
    more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research
    into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.

  title: 'SERPENT-VLM : Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language
    Models'
- abstract: Improving the accessibility of psychotherapy with the aid of Large Language
    Models (LLMs) is garnering a significant attention in recent years. Recognizing
    cognitive distortions from the interviewee's utterances can be an essential part
    of psychotherapy, especially for cognitive behavioral therapy. In this paper,
    we propose ERD, which improves LLM-based cognitive distortion classification performance
    with the aid of additional modules of (1) extracting the parts related to cognitive
    distortion, and (2) debating the reasoning steps by multiple agents. Our experimental
    results on a public dataset show that ERD improves the multi-class F1 score as
    well as binary specificity score. Regarding the latter score, it turns out that
    our method is effective in debiasing the baseline method which has high false
    positive rate, especially when the summary of multi-agent debate is provided to
    LLMs.

  title: 'ERD: A Framework for Improving LLM Reasoning for Cognitive Distortion Classification'
- abstract: 'Automatic conversion of free-text radiology reports into structured data
    using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is crucial for analyzing diseases
    on a large scale. While effective for tasks in widely spoken languages like English,
    generative large language models (LLMs) typically underperform with less common
    languages and can pose potential risks to patient privacy. Fine-tuning local NLP
    models is hindered by the skewed nature of real-world medical datasets, where
    rare findings represent a significant data imbalance. We introduce SMP-BERT, a
    novel prompt learning method that leverages the structured nature of reports to
    overcome these challenges. In our studies involving a substantial collection of
    Crohn''s disease radiology reports in Hebrew (over 8,000 patients and 10,000 reports),
    SMP-BERT greatly surpassed traditional fine-tuning methods in performance, notably
    in detecting infrequent conditions (AUC: 0.99 vs 0.94, F1: 0.84 vs 0.34). SMP-BERT
    empowers more accurate AI diagnostics available for low-resource languages.'

  title: Leveraging Prompt-Learning for Structured Information Extraction from Crohn‚Äôs
    Disease Radiology Reports in a Low-Resource Language
- abstract: In the realm of dialogue systems, generated responses often lack personalization.
    This is particularly true in the medical domain, where research is limited by
    scarce available domain-specific data and the complexities of modeling medical
    context and persona information. In this work, we investigate the potential of
    harnessing large language models for personalized medical dialogue generation.
    In particular, to better aggregate the long conversational context, we adopt topic-focused
    summarization to distill core information from the dialogue history, and use such
    information to guide the conversation flow and generated content. Drawing inspiration
    from real-world telehealth conversations, we outline a comprehensive pipeline
    encompassing data processing, profile construction, and domain adaptation. This
    work not only highlights our technical approach but also shares distilled insights
    from the data preparation and model construction phases.

  title: Context Aggregation with Topic-focused Summarization for Personalized Medical
    Dialogue Generation
- abstract: This paper explores the impact of incorporating sentiment, emotion, and
    domain-specific lexicons into a transformer-based model for depression symptom
    estimation. Lexicon information is added by marking the words in the input transcripts
    of patient-therapist conversations as well as in social media posts. Overall results
    show that the introduction of external knowledge within pre-trained language models
    can be beneficial for prediction performance, while different lexicons show distinct
    behaviours depending on the targeted task. Additionally, new state-of-the-art
    results are obtained for the estimation of depression level over patient-therapist
    interviews.

  title: Evaluating Lexicon Incorporation for Depression Symptom Estimation
- abstract: 'We construct a word complexity lexicon for medical terms in Japanese.

    To facilitate communication between medical practitioners and patients, medical
    text simplification is being studied.

    Medical text simplification is a natural language processing task that paraphrases
    complex technical terms into expressions that patients can understand.

    However, in contrast to English, where this task is being actively studied, there
    are insufficient language resources in Japanese.

    As a first step in advancing research on medical text simplification in Japanese,
    we annotate the 370,000 words from a large-scale medical terminology lexicon with
    a five-point scale of complexity for patients.'

  title: 'TEAM MIPAL at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Large VQA Models for Dermatological Diagnosis'
- abstract: The MEDIQA-M3G 2024 challenge necessitates novel solutions for Multilingual
    \& Multimodal Medical Answer Generation in dermatology  (wai Yim et al., 2024a).
    This paper addresses the limitations of traditional methods by proposing a weakly
    supervised learning approach for open-ended medical question-answering (QA). Our
    system leverages readily available MEDIQA-M3G images via a VGG16-CNN-SVM model,
    enabling multilingual (English, Chinese, Spanish) learning of informative skin
    condition representations. Using pre-trained QA models, we further bridge the
    gap between visual and textual information through multimodal fusion. This approach
    tackles complex, open-ended questions even without predefined answer choices.
    We empower the generation of comprehensive answers by feeding the ViT-CLIP model
    with multiple responses alongside images. This work advances medical QA research,
    paving the way for clinical decision support systems and ultimately improving
    healthcare delivery.

  title: 'MediFact at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Medical Question Answering in Dermatology with
    Multimodal Learning'
- abstract: Accurate representation of medical information is crucial for patient
    safety, yet artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as Large Language Models
    (LLMs), encounter challenges in error-free clinical text interpretation. This
    paper presents a novel approach submitted to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task
    k (Ben Abacha et al., 2024a), focusing on the automatic correction of single-word
    errors in clinical notes. Unlike LLMs that rely on extensive generic data, our
    method emphasizes extracting contextually relevant information from available
    clinical text data. Leveraging an ensemble of extractive and abstractive question-answering
    approaches, we construct a supervised learning framework with domain-specific
    feature engineering. Our methodology incorporates domain expertise to enhance
    error correction accuracy. By integrating domain expertise and prioritizing meaningful
    information extraction, our approach underscores the significance of a human-centric
    strategy in adapting AI for healthcare.

  title: 'MediFact at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Why AI Needs a Human Touch'
- abstract: This paper describes our submission to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task
    for automatically detecting and correcting medical errors in clinical notes. We
    report results for three methods of few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) augmented
    with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reason prompts using a large language model (LLM).
    In the first method, we manually analyse a subset of train and validation dataset
    to infer three CoT prompts by examining error types in the clinical notes. In
    the second method, we utilise the training dataset to prompt the LLM to deduce
    reasons about their correctness or incorrectness. The constructed CoTs and reasons
    are then augmented with ICL examples to solve the tasks of error detection, span
    identification, and error correction. Finally, we combine the two methods using
    a rule-based ensemble method. Across the three sub-tasks, our ensemble method
    achieves a ranking of 3rd for both sub-task 1 and 2, while securing 7th place
    in sub-task 3 among all submissions.

  title: 'KnowLab_AIMed at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Chain-of-Though (CoT) prompting strategies
    for medical error detection and correction'
- abstract: This paper presents our approach to the EHRSQL-2024 shared task, which
    aims to develop a reliable Text-to-SQL system for electronic health records. We
    propose two approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs) for prompting
    and fine-tuning to generate EHRSQL queries. In both techniques, we concentrate
    on bridging the gap between the real-world knowledge on which LLMs are trained
    and the domain-specific knowledge required for the task. The paper provides the
    results of each approach individually, demonstrating that they achieve high execution
    accuracy. Additionally, we show that an ensemble approach further enhances generation
    reliability by reducing errors. This approach secured us 2nd place in the shared
    task competition. The methodologies outlined in this paper are designed to be
    transferable to domain-specific Text-to-SQL problems that emphasize both accuracy
    and reliability.

  title: 'PromptMind Team at EHRSQL-2024: Improving Reliability of SQL Generation
    using Ensemble LLMs'
- abstract: 'This paper describes our approach to the MEDIQA-CORR shared task, which
    involves error detection and correction in clinical notes curated by medical professionals.
    This task involves handling three subtasks: detecting the presence of errors,
    identifying the specific sentence containing the error, and correcting it. Through
    our work, we aim to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained
    on a vast corpora of internet data that contain both factual and unreliable information.
    We propose to comprehensively address all subtasks together, and suggest employing
    a unique prompt-based in-context learning strategy. We will evaluate its efficacy
    in this specialized task demanding a combination of general reasoning and medical
    knowledge. In medical systems where prediction errors can have grave consequences,
    we propose leveraging self-consistency and ensemble methods to enhance error correction
    and error detection performance.'

    with Error Categorization and LLM Ensembles'
- abstract: 'Addressing the critical challenge of identifying and rectifying medical
    errors in clinical notes, we present a novel approach tailored for the MEDIQA-CORR
    task @ NAACL-ClinicalNLP 2024, which comprises three subtasks: binary classification,
    span identification, and natural language generation for error detection and correction.
    Binary classification involves detecting whether the text contains a medical error;
    span identification entails identifying the text span associated with any detected
    error; and natural language generation focuses on providing a free text correction
    if a medical error exists. Our proposed architecture leverages Named Entity Recognition
    (NER) for identifying disease-related terms, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    for contextual understanding from external datasets, and a quantized and fine-tuned
    Palmyra model for error correction. Our model achieved a global rank of 5 with
    an aggregate score of 0.73298, calculated as the mean of ROUGE-1-F, BERTScore,
    and BLEURT scores.'

  title: 'Lexicans at Chemotimelines 2024: Chemotimeline Chronicles - Leveraging Large
    Language Models (LLMs) for Temporal Relations Extraction in Oncological Electronic
    Health Records'
- abstract: 'This paper presents our two deep learning-based approaches to participate
    in subtask 1 of the Chemotimelines 2024 Shared task. The first uses a fine-tuning
    strategy on a relatively small general domain Masked Language Model (MLM) model,
    with additional normalization steps obtained using a simple Large Language Model
    (LLM) prompting technique. The second is an LLM-based approach combining advanced
    automated prompt search with few-shot in-context learning using the DSPy framework.

    Our results confirm the continued relevance of the smaller MLM fine-tuned model.
    It also suggests that the automated few-shot LLM approach can perform close to
    the fine-tuning-based method without extra LLM normalization and be advantageous
    under scarce data access conditions. We finally hint at the possibility to choose
    between lower training examples or lower computing resources requirements when
    considering both methods.'

    methods, can generative LLM do it all or is smaller model fine-tuning still relevant
    ?'
- abstract: 'This paper presents our participation in the Chemotimelines 2024 subtask2,
    focusing on the development of an end-to-end system for chemotherapy timeline
    extraction. We initially adopt a basic framework from subtask2, utilizing Apache
    cTAKES for entity recognition and a BERT-based model for classifying the temporal
    relationship between chemotherapy events and associated times. Subsequently, we
    enhance this pipeline through two key directions: first, by expanding the exploration
    of the system, achieved by extending the search dictionary of cTAKES with the
    UMLS database; second, by reducing false positives through preprocessing of clinical
    notes and implementing filters to reduce the potential errors from the BERT-based
    model. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments
    using clinical notes from breast, ovarian, and melanoma cancer cases. Our results
    demonstrate improvements over the previous approach.'

  title: 'Project PRIMUS at EHRSQL 2024 : Text-to-SQL Generation using Large Language
    Model for EHR Analysis'
- abstract: The extraction of chemotherapy treatment timelines from clinical narratives
    poses significant challenges due to the complexity of medical language and patient-specific
    treatment regimens. This paper describes the NYULangone team's approach to Subtask
    2 of the Chemotimelines 2024 shared task, focusing on leveraging a locally hosted
    Large Language Model (LLM), Mixtral 8x7B (Mistral AI, France), to interpret and
    extract relevant events from clinical notes without relying on domain-specific
    training data. Despite facing challenges due to the task's complexity and the
    current capacity of open-source AI, our methodology highlights the future potential
    of local foundational LLMs in specialized domains like biomedical data processing.

    Models for Chemotherapy Event Extraction'
- abstract: "This paper presents a system developed for the Clinical NLP 2024 Shared\
    \ Task, focusing on reliable text-to-SQL modeling on Electronic Health Records\
    \ (EHRs). The goal is to create a model that accurately generates SQL queries\
    \ for answerable questions while avoiding incorrect responses and handling unanswerable\
    \ queries. Our approach comprises three main components: a query correspondence\
    \ model, a text-to-SQL model, and an SQL verifier.\nFor the query correspondence\
    \ model, we trained a logistic regression model using hand-crafted features to\
    \ distinguish between answerable and unanswerable queries. As for the text-to-SQL\
    \ model, we utilized T5-3B as a pretrained language model, further fine-tuned\
    \ on pairs of natural language questions and corresponding SQL queries. Finally,\
    \ we applied the SQL verifier to inspect the resulting SQL queries.\nDuring the\
    \ evaluation stage of the shared task, our system achieved an accuracy of 68.9\
    \ % (metric version without penalty), positioning it at the fifth-place ranking.\
    \ \nWhile our approach did not surpass solutions based on large language models\
    \ (LMMs) like ChatGPT, it demonstrates the promising potential of domain-specific\
    \ specialized models that are more resource-efficient. \nThe code is publicly\

    through VLM Fine-tuning and LLM Translations'
- abstract: 'This document describes our solution to the MEDIQA-M3G: Multilingual
    & Multimodal Medical Answer Generation. To build our solution, we leveraged two
    pre-trained models, a Visual Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM).
    We fine-tuned both models using the MEDIQA-M3G and MEDIQA-CORR training datasets,
    respectively. In the first stage, the VLM provides singular responses for each
    pair of image & text inputs in a case. In the second stage, the LLM consolidates
    the VLM responses using it as context among the original text input. By changing
    the original English case content field in the context component of the second
    stage to the one in Spanish, we adapt the pipeline to generate submissions in
    English and Spanish. We performed an ablation study to explore the impact of the
    different models'' capabilities, such as multimodality and reasoning, on the MEDIQA-M3G
    task. Our approach favored privacy and feasibility by adopting open-source and

  title: 'NEUI at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Medical VQA through consensus'
- abstract: The automatic identification of medical errors in clinical notes is crucial
    for improving the quality of healthcare services.LLMs emerge as a powerful artificial
    intelligence tool for automating this task. However, LLMs present vulnerabilities,
    high costs, and sometimes a lack of transparency. This article addresses the detection
    of medical errors through the fine-tuning approach, conducting a comprehensive
    comparison between various models and exploring in depth the components of the
    machine learning pipeline. The results obtained with the fine-tuned ClinicalBert
    and Gated recurrent units  (Gru)  models show an accuracy of 0.56 and 0.55, respectively.
    This approach not only mitigates the problems associated with the use of LLMs
    but also demonstrates how exhaustive iteration in critical phases of the pipeline,
    especially in feature selection, can facilitate the automation of clinical record
    analysis.

- abstract: 'The MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task aims to assess the ability of Large
    Language Models (LLMs) to identify and correct medical errors in clinical notes.
    In this study, we evaluate the capability of general LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5
    and GPT-4, to identify and correct medical errors with multiple prompting strategies.
    Recognising the limitation of LLMs in generating accurate corrections only via
    prompting strategies, we propose incorporating error-span predictions from a smaller,
    fine-tuned model in two ways: 1) by presenting it as a hint in the prompt and
    2) by framing it as multiple-choice questions from which the LLM can choose the
    best correction. We found that our proposed prompting strategies significantly
    improve the LLM''s ability to generate corrections. Our best-performing solution
    with 8-shot + CoT + hints ranked sixth in the shared task leaderboard. Additionally,
    our comprehensive analyses show the impact of the location of the error sentence,
    the prompted role, and the position of the multiple-choice option on the accuracy
    of the LLM. This prompts further questions about the readiness of LLM to be implemented
    in real-world clinical settings.'

  title: 'Edinburgh Clinical NLP at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Guiding Large Language Models
    with Hints'
- abstract: This paper presents our team's participation in the MEDIQA-ClinicalNLP
    2024 shared task B. We present a novel approach to diagnosing clinical dermatology
    cases by integrating large multimodal models, specifically leveraging the capabilities
    of GPT-4V under a retriever and a re-ranker framework. Our investigation reveals
    that GPT-4V, when used as a retrieval agent, can accurately retrieve the correct
    skin condition 85\% of the time using dermatological images and brief patient
    histories. Additionally, we empirically show that Naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
    works well for retrieval while Medical Guidelines Grounded CoT is required for
    accurate dermatological diagnosis. Further, we introduce a Multi-Agent Conversation
    (MAC) framework and show it‚Äôs superior performance and potential over the best
    CoT strategy. The experiments suggest that using naive CoT for retrieval and multi-agent
    conversation for critique-based diagnosis, GPT-4V can lead to an early and accurate
    diagnosis of dermatological conditions. The implications of this work extend to
    improving diagnostic workflows, supporting dermatological education, and enhancing
    patient care by providing a scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool.

  title: 'UMass-BioNLP at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: DermPrompt - A Systematic Exploration of
    Prompt Engineering with GPT-4V for Dermatological Diagnosis'
- abstract: "Recent advancements in large language models (LM) like OpenAI's GPT-4\
    \ have shown promise in healthcare, particularly in medical question answering\
    \ and clinical applications. However, their deployment raises privacy concerns\
    \ and their size limits use in resource-constrained environments.\nSmaller open-source\
    \ LMs have emerged as alternatives, but their reliability in medicine remains\
    \ underexplored.\nThis study evaluates small LMs in the medical field using the\
    \ MEDIQA-CORR 2024 task, which assesses the ability of models to identify and\
    \ correct errors in clinical notes. \nInitially, zero-shot inference and simple\
    \ fine-tuning of small models resulted in poor performance. \nWhen fine-tuning\
    \ with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning using synthetic data generated by GPT-4,\
    \ their performance significantly improved. \nMeerkat-7B, a small LM trained with\
    \ medical CoT reasoning, demonstrated notable performance gains. Our model outperforms\
    \ other small non-commercial LMs and some larger models, achieving a 73.36 aggregate\
    \ score on MEDIQA-CORR 2024."

  title: 'KU-DMIS at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Exploring the Reasoning Capabilities of Small
    Language Models in Medical Error Correction'
- abstract: 'This paper demonstrates CLD-MEC team submission to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024
    shared task for identifying and correcting medical errors from clinical notes.
    We developed a framework to track two main types of medical errors: diagnostics
    and medical management-related errors. The tracking framework is implied utilizing
    a GPT-4 multi-stage prompting-based pipeline that ends with the three downstream
    tasks: classification of medical error existence (Task 1), identification of error
    location (Task 2), and correction error (Task 3). Throughout the pipeline, we
    employed clinical Chain of Thought (CoT) and Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)  techniques
    to mitigate the hallucination and enforce the clinical context learning. The model
    performance is acceptable, given it is based on zero-shot learning. In addition,
    we developed a RAG system injected with clinical practice guidelines as an external
    knowledge datastore. Our RAG is based on the Bio_ClinicalBERT as a vector embedding
    model. However, our RAG system failed to get the desired results. We proposed
    recommendations to be investigated in future research work to overcome the limitations
    of our approach.'

  title: 'CLD-MEC at MEDIQA- CORR 2024 Task: GPT-4 Multi-Stage Clinical Chain of Thought
    Prompting for Medical Errors Detection and Correction'
- abstract: The 2024 Shared Task on Chemotherapy Treatment Timeline Extraction aims
    to advance the state of the art of clinical event timeline extraction from the
    Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Specifically, this edition focuses on chemotherapy
    event timelines from EHRs of patients with breast, ovarian and skin cancers. These
    patient-level timelines present a novel challenge which involves tasks such as
    the extraction of relevant events, time expressions and temporal relations from
    each document and then summarizing over the documents. De-identified EHRs for
    57,530 patients with breast and ovarian cancer spanning 2004-2020, and approximately
    15,946 patients with melanoma spanning 2010-2020 were made available to participants
    after executing a Data Use Agreement. A subset of patients is annotated for gold
    entities, time expressions, temporal relations and patient-level timelines. The
    rest is considered unlabeled data. In Subtask1, gold chemotherapy event mentions
    and time expressions are provided (along with the EHR notes). Participants are
    asked to build the patient-level timelines using gold annotations as input. Thus,
    the subtask seeks to explore the topics of temporal relations extraction and timeline
    creation if event and time expression input is perfect. In Subtask2, which is
    the realistic real-world setting, only EHR notes are provided. Thus, the subtask
    aims at developing an end-to-end system for chemotherapy treatment timeline extraction
    from patient's EHR notes. There were 18 submissions for Subtask 1 and 9 submissions
    for Subtask 2. The organizers provided a baseline system. The teams employed a
    variety of methods including Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, n-grams, transformer
    models, zero-shot prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs), and instruction
    tuning. The gap in performance between prompting LLMs and finetuning smaller-sized
    LMs indicates that for a challenging task such as patient-level chemotherapy timeline
    extraction, more sophisticated LLMs or prompting techniques are necessary in order
    to achieve optimal results as finetuing smaller-sized LMs outperforms by a wide
    margin.

  title: Overview of the 2024 Shared Task on Chemotherapy Treatment Timeline Extraction
- abstract: In natural language processing applied to the clinical domain, utilizing
    large language models has emerged as a promising avenue for error detection and
    correction on clinical notes, a knowledge-intensive task for which annotated data
    is scarce. This paper presents MedReAct'N'MedReFlex, which leverages a suite of
    four LLM-based medical agents. The MedReAct agent initiates the process by observing,
    analyzing, and taking action, generating trajectories to guide the search to target
    a potential error in the clinical notes. Subsequently, the MedEval agent employs
    five evaluators to assess the targeted error and the proposed correction. In cases
    where MedReAct's actions prove insufficient, the MedReFlex agent intervenes, engaging
    in reflective analysis and proposing alternative strategies. Finally, the MedFinalParser
    agent formats the final output, preserving the original style while ensuring the
    integrity of the error correction process. One core component of our method is
    our RAG pipeline based on our ClinicalCorp corpora. Among other well-known sources
    containing clinical guidelines and information, we preprocess and release the
    open-source MedWiki dataset for clinical RAG application. Our results demonstrate
    the central role of our RAG approach with ClinicalCorp leveraged through the MedReAct'N'MedReFlex
    framework. It achieved the ninth rank on the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 final leaderboard.

  title: 'IryoNLP at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Tackling the Medical Error Detection & Correction
    Task on the Shoulders of Medical Agents'
- abstract: Remote patient care provides opportunities for expanding medical access,
    saving healthcare costs, and offering on-demand convenient services. In the MEDIQA-M3G
    2024 Shared Task, researchers explored solutions for the specific task of dermatological
    consumer health visual question answering, where user generated queries and images
    are used as input and a free-text answer response is generated as output. In this
    novel challenge, eight teams with a total of 48 submissions were evaluated across
    three language test sets. In this work, we provide a summary of the dataset, as
    well as results and approaches. We  hope that the insights learned here will inspire
    future research directions that can lead to technology that  deburdens clinical
    workload and improves care.

    Answer Generation
- abstract: 'This paper describes our submission to MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task for
    automatic identification and correction of medical errors in a given clinical
    text. We report results from two approaches: the first uses a few-shot in-context
    learning (ICL) with a Large Language Model (LLM) and the second approach extends
    the idea by using a knowledge-enhanced few-shot ICL approach. We used Azure OpenAI
    GPT-4 API as the LLM and Wikipedia as the external knowledge source. We report
    evaluation metrics (accuracy, ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) across both approaches
    for validation and test datasets. Of the two approaches implemented, our experimental
    results show that the knowledge-enhanced few-shot ICL approach with GPT-4 performed
    better with error flag (subtask A) and error sentence detection (subtask B) with
    accuracies of 68% and 64%, respectively on the test dataset. These results positioned
    us fourth in subtask A and second in subtask B, respectively in the shared task.'

  title: Overview of the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 Shared Task on Medical Error Detection and
    Correction
- abstract: This paper presents our approach for the 2024 ChemoTimelines shared task.
    Specifically, we explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) for temporal relation
    extraction. We evaluate multiple model variations based on how the training data
    is used. For instance, we transform the task into a question-answering problem
    and use QA pairs to extract chemo-related events and their temporal relations.
    Next, we add all the documents to each question-answer pair as examples in our
    training dataset. Finally, we explore adding unlabeled data for continued pretraining.
    Each addition is done iteratively. Our results show that adding the document helps,
    but unlabeled data does not yield performance improvements, possibly because we
    used only 1\% of the available data. Moreover, we find that instruction-tuned
    models still substantially underperform more traditional systems (e.g., EntityBERT).

  title: 'UTSA-NLP at ChemoTimelines 2024: Evaluating Instruction-Tuned Language Models
    for Temporal Relation Extraction'
- abstract: 'Medical errors in clinical text pose significant risks to patient safety.
    The MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task focuses on detecting and correcting these errors
    across three subtasks: identifying the presence of an error, extracting the erroneous
    sentence, and generating a corrected sentence. In this paper, we present our approach
    that achieved top performance in all three subtasks. For the MS dataset, which
    contains subtle errors, we developed a retrieval-based system leveraging external
    medical question-answering datasets. For the UW dataset, reflecting more realistic
    clinical notes, we created a pipeline of modules to detect, localize, and correct
    errors. Both approaches utilized the DSPy framework for optimizing prompts and
    few-shot examples in large language model (LLM) based programs. Our results demonstrate
    the effectiveness of LLM based programs for medical error correction. However,
    our approach has limitations in addressing the full diversity of potential errors
    in medical documentation. We discuss the implications of our work and highlight
    future research directions to advance the robustness and applicability of medical
    error detection and correction systems.'

- abstract: This paper outlines our submission to the MEDIQA2024 Multilingual and
    Multimodal Medical Answer Generation (M3G) shared task. We report results for
    two standalone solutions under the English category of the task, the first involving
    two consecutive API calls to the Claude 3 Opus API and the second involving training
    an image-disease label joint embedding in the style of CLIP for image classification.
    These two solutions scored 1st and 2nd place respectively on the competition leaderboard,
    substantially outperforming the next best solution. Additionally, we discuss insights
    gained from post-competition experiments. While the performance of these two described
    solutions have significant room for improvement due to the difficulty of the shared
    task and the challenging nature of medical visual question answering in general,
    we identify the multi-stage LLM approach and the CLIP image classification approach
    as promising avenues for further investigation.

    Language Models'
- abstract: Text-to-SQL models are pivotal for making Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
    accessible to healthcare professionals without SQL knowledge. With the advancements
    in large language models, these systems have become more adept at translating
    complex questions into SQL queries. Nonetheless, the critical need for reliability
    in healthcare necessitates these models to accurately identify unanswerable questions
    or uncertain predictions, preventing misinformation. To address this problem,
    we present a self-training strategy using pseudo-labeled unanswerable questions
    to enhance the reliability of text-to-SQL models for EHRs. This approach includes
    a two-stage training process followed by a filtering method based on the token
    entropy and query execution. Our methodology's effectiveness is validated by our
    top performance in the EHRSQL 2024 shared task, showcasing the potential to improve
    healthcare decision-making through more reliable text-to-SQL systems.

  title: 'LG AI Research & KAIST at EHRSQL 2024: Self-Training Large Language Models
    with Pseudo-Labeled Unanswerable Questions for a Reliable Text-to-SQL System on
    EHRs'
- abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are relational databases that store the
    entire medical histories of patients within hospitals. They record numerous aspects
    of patients' medical care, from hospital admission and diagnosis to treatment
    and discharge. While EHRs are vital sources of clinical data, exploring them beyond
    a predefined set of queries requires skills in query languages like SQL. To make
    information retrieval more accessible, one strategy is to build a question-answering
    system, possibly leveraging text-to-SQL models that can automatically translate
    natural language questions into corresponding SQL queries and use these queries
    to retrieve the answers. The EHRSQL 2024 shared task aims to advance and promote
    research in developing a question-answering system for EHRs using text-to-SQL
    modeling, capable of reliably providing requested answers to various healthcare
    professionals to improve their clinical work processes and satisfy their needs.
    Among more than 100 participants who applied to the shared task, eight teams completed
    the entire shared task processes and demonstrated a wide range of methods to effectively
    solve this task. In this paper, we describe the task of reliable text-to-SQL modeling,
    the dataset, and the methods and results of the participants. We hope this shared
    task will spur further research and insights into developing reliable question-answering
    systems for EHRs.

  title: Overview of the EHRSQL 2024 Shared Task on Reliable Text-to-SQL Modeling
    on Electronic Health Records
- abstract: The EHRSQL task aims to develop a dependable text-to-SQL model for Electronic
    Health Records (EHR) databases, which are crucial sources of clinical data that
    store patients' medical histories in hospitals. Large language models (LLM) have
    been proven to exhibit state-of-the-art performance for text-to-SQL tasks across
    various domains. To this end, we have developed a framework, SQL Generation through
    Classification Answer Selector by LLM (SCAS), which comprises two modules. The
    CAS module determines the answerability of the question, while the SG model generates
    the SQL query exclusively for answerable questions. Our system ranked 7th on the
    leaderboard with a Reliability Score of 53.21 on the official test set.

  title: 'Saama Technologies at EHRSQL 2024: SQL Generation through Classification
    Answer Selector by LLM'
- abstract: Transforming natural language questions into SQL queries is crucial for
    precise data retrieval from electronic health record (EHR) databases. A significant
    challenge in this process is detecting and rejecting unanswerable questions that
    request information outside the database's scope or exceed the system's capabilities.
    In this paper, we introduce a novel text-to-SQL framework that focuses on standardizing
    the structure of questions into a templated format. Our framework begins by fine-tuning
    GPT-3.5-turbo, a powerful large language model (LLM), with detailed prompts involving
    the table schemas of the EHR database system. Our approach shows promising results
    on the EHRSQL-2024 benchmark dataset, part of the ClinicalNLP shared task. Although
    fine-tuning GPT achieves third place on the development set, it struggled with
    the diverse questions in the test set. With our framework, we improve our system's
    adaptability and achieve fourth position in the official leaderboard of the EHRSQL-2024
    challenge.

  title: 'KU-DMIS at EHRSQL 2024 : Generating SQL query via question templatization
    in EHR'
- abstract: 'Recently, deep learning-based language models have significantly enhanced
    text-to-SQL tasks, with promising applications in retrieving patient records within
    the medical domain. One notable challenge in such applications is discerning unanswerable
    queries. Through fine-tuning model, we demonstrate the feasibility of converting
    medical record inquiries into SQL queries. Additionally, we introduce an entropy-based
    method to identify and filter out unanswerable results. We further enhance result
    quality by filtering low-confidence SQL through log probability-based distribution,
    while grammatical and schema errors are mitigated by executing queries on the
    actual database.

    We experimentally verified that our method can filter unanswerable questions,
    which can be widely utilized even when the parameters of the model are not accessible,
    and that it can be effectively utilized in practice.'

  title: 'ProbGate at EHRSQL 2024: Enhancing SQL Query Generation Accuracy through
    Probabilistic Threshold Filtering and Error Handling'
- abstract: In this paper, we present our work in the EHRSQL 2024 shared task which
    tackles reliable text-to-SQL modeling on Electronic Health Records. Our proposed
    system tackles the task with three modules - abstention module, text-to-SQL generation
    module, and reliability module. The abstention module identifies whether the question
    is answerable given the database schema. If the question is answerable, the text-to-SQL
    generation module generates the SQL query and associated confidence score. The
    reliability module has two key components - confidence score thresholding, which
    rejects generations with confidence below a pre-defined level, and error filtering,
    which identifies and excludes SQL queries that result in execution errors. In
    the official leaderboard for the task, our system ranks 6th. We have also made
    the source code public.

  title: 'LTRC-IIITH at EHRSQL 2024: Enhancing Reliability of Text-to-SQL Systems
    through Abstention and Confidence Thresholding'
- abstract: In this paper, we present our work to the MEDIQA-M3G 2024 shared task,
    which tackles multilingual and multimodal medical answer generation. Our system
    consists of a lightweight Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) model which is
    fine-tuned for the clinical dermatology visual question-answering task. In the
    official leaderboard for the task, our system ranks 6th. After the challenge,
    we experiment with training the ViLT model on more data. We also explore the capabilities
    of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Gemini and LLaVA.
