- abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in medical contexts has the potential
    to save time, cut costs, increase report accuracy, and reduce physician burnout.
    However, the healthcare industry has been slower to adopt this technology, in
    part due to the importance of avoiding medically-relevant transcription mistakes.
    In this work, we present the Clinical BERTScore (CBERTScore), an ASR metric that
    penalizes clinically-relevant mistakes more than others. We collect a benchmark
    of 18 clinician preferences on 149 realistic medical sentences called the Clinician
    Transcript Preference benchmark (CTP) and make it publicly available for the community
    to further develop clinically-aware ASR metrics. To our knowledge, this is the
    first public dataset of its kind. We demonstrate that our metric more closely
    aligns with clinician preferences on medical sentences as compared to other metrics
    (WER, BLUE, METEOR, etc), sometimes by wide margins.

  title: 'Clinical BERTScore: An Improved Measure of Automatic Speech Recognition
    Performance in Clinical Settings'
- abstract: 'Assessing the capacity of numerical understanding of vision-and-language
    models over images and texts is crucial for real vision-and-language applications,
    such as systems for automated medical image analysis.

    We provide a visual reasoning dataset focusing on numerical understanding in the
    medical domain.

    The experiments using our dataset show that current vision-and-language models
    fail to perform numerical inference in the medical domain.

    However, the data augmentation with only a small amount of our dataset improves
    the model performance, while maintaining the performance in the general domain.'

  title: Medical Visual Textual Entailment for Numerical Understanding of Vision-and-Language
    Models
- abstract: Valuable datasets that contain sensitive information are not shared due
    to privacy and copyright concerns. This hinders progress in many areas and prevents
    the use of machine learning solutions to solve relevant tasks. One possible solution
    is sharing models that are trained on such datasets. However, this is also associated
    with potential privacy risks due to data extraction attacks. In this work, we
    propose a solution based on sharing parts of the model's parameters, and using
    a proxy dataset for complimentary knowledge transfer. Our experiments show encouraging
    results, and reduced risk to potential training data identification attacks. We
    present a viable solution to sharing knowledge with data-disadvantaged parties,
    that do not have the resources to produce high-quality data, with reduced privacy
    risks to the sharing parties. We make our code publicly available.

  title: Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Transfer through Partial Parameter Sharing
- abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
    cognitive abilities and memory, especially in older adults. One of the challenges
    of AD is that it can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages. However, recent
    research has shown that changes in language, including speech decline and difficulty
    in processing information, can be important indicators of AD and may help with
    early detection. Hence, the speech narratives of the patients can be useful in
    diagnosing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. While the previous works have
    presented the potential of using speech narratives to diagnose AD in high-resource
    languages, this work explores the possibility of using a low-resourced language,
    i.e., Hindi language, to diagnose AD. In this paper, we present a dataset specifically
    for analyzing AD in the Hindi language, along with experimental results using
    various state-of-the-art algorithms to assess the diagnostic potential of speech
    narratives in Hindi. Our analysis suggests that speech narratives in the Hindi
    language have the potential to aid in the diagnosis of AD. Our dataset and code
    are made publicly available at https://github.com/rkritesh210/DementiaBankHindi.

  title: 'Breaking Barriers: Exploring the Diagnostic Potential of Speech Narratives
    in Hindi for Alzheimer''s Disease'
- abstract: 'Massively multilingual pre-trained language models (MMPLMs) are developed
    in recent years demonstrating superpowers and the pre-knowledge they acquire for
    downstream tasks.

    This work investigates whether MMPLMs can be applied to clinical domain machine
    translation (MT) towards entirely unseen languages via transfer learning.

    We carry out an experimental investigation using Meta-AI''s MMPLMs ``wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-X
    and X-en (WMT21fb)'''' which were pre-trained on 7 language pairs and 14 translation
    directions including English to Czech, German, Hausa, Icelandic, Japanese, Russian,
    and Chinese, and the opposite direction.

    We fine-tune these MMPLMs towards English-\textit{Spanish} language pair which
    \textit{did not exist at all} in their original pre-trained corpora both implicitly
    and explicitly.

    We prepare carefully aligned \textit{clinical} domain data for this fine-tuning,
    which is different from their original mixed domain knowledge.

    Our experimental result shows that the fine-tuning is very successful using just
    250k well-aligned in-domain EN-ES segments for three sub-task translation testings:
    clinical cases, clinical terms, and ontology concepts. It achieves very close
    evaluation scores to another MMPLM NLLB from Meta-AI, which included Spanish as
    a high-resource setting in the pre-training.

    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on using MMPLMs towards \textit{clinical
    domain transfer-learning NMT} successfully for totally unseen languages during
    pre-training.'

  title: Investigating Massive Multilingual Pre-Trained Machine Translation Models
    for Clinical Domain via Transfer Learning
- abstract: The Coronavirus pandemic has heightened the demand for technological solutions
    capable of gathering and monitoring data automatically, quickly, and securely.
    To achieve this need, the Plantão Coronavirus chatbot has been made available
    to the population of Ceará State in Brazil. This chatbot employs automated symptom
    detection technology through Natural Language Processing (NLP). The proposal of
    this work is a symptom tracker, which is a neural network that processes texts
    and captures symptoms in messages exchanged between citizens of the state and
    the Plantão Coronavirus nurse/doctor, i.e., clinical conversations. The model
    has the ability to recognize new patterns and has identified a high incidence
    of altered psychological behaviors, including anguish, anxiety, and sadness, among
    users who tested positive or negative for Covid-19. As a result, the tool has
    emphasized the importance of expanding coverage through community mental health
    services in the state.

  title: Tracking the Evolution of Covid-19 Symptoms through Clinical Conversations
- abstract: 'In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical research, accurate and concise
    summarization of clinical studies is crucial to support evidence-based practice.
    This paper presents a novel approach to clinical studies summarization, leveraging
    reinforcement learning to enhance factual consistency and align with human annotator
    preferences. Our work focuses on two tasks: Conclusion Generation and Review Generation.
    We train a CONFIT summarization model that outperforms GPT-3 and previous state-of-the-art
    models on the same datasets and collects expert and crowd-worker annotations to
    evaluate the quality and factual consistency of the generated summaries. These
    annotations enable us to measure the correlation of various automatic metrics,
    including modern factual evaluation metrics like QAFactEval, with human-assessed
    factual consistency. By employing top-correlated metrics as objectives for a reinforcement
    learning model, we demonstrate improved factuality in generated summaries that
    are preferred by human annotators. '

  title: Aligning Factual Consistency for Clinical Studies Summarization through Reinforcement
    Learning
- abstract: Pretrained language models leverage self-supervised learning to use large
    amounts of unlabeled text for learning contextual representations of sequences.
    However, in the domain of medical conversations, the availability of large, public
    datasets is limited due to issues of privacy and data management. In this paper,
    we study the effectiveness of dialog-aware pretraining objectives and multiphase
    training in using unlabeled data to improve LMs training for medical utterance
    classification. The objectives of pretraining for dialog awareness involve tasks
    that take into account the structure of conversations, including features such
    as turn-taking and the roles of speakers. The multiphase training process uses
    unannotated data in a sequence that prioritizes similarities and connections between
    different domains. We empirically evaluate these methods on conversational dialog
    classification tasks in the medical and counseling domains, and find that multiphase
    training can help achieve higher performance than standard pretraining or finetuning.

  title: 'Navigating Data Scarcity: Pretraining for Medical Utterance Classification'
- abstract: In developing countries like India, doctors and healthcare professionals
    working in public health spend significant time answering health queries that
    are fact-based and repetitive. Therefore, we propose an automated way to answer
    maternal and child health-related queries. A database of Frequently Asked Questions
    (FAQs) and their corresponding answers generated by experts is curated from rural
    health workers and young mothers. We develop a Hindi chatbot that identifies k
    relevant Question and Answer (QnA) pairs from the database in response to a healthcare
    query (q) written in Devnagri script or Hindi-English (Hinglish) code-mixed script.
    The curated database covers 80% of all the queries that a user of our study is
    likely to ask. We experimented with (i) rule-based methods, (ii) sentence embeddings,
    and (iii) a paraphrasing classifier, to calculate the q-Q similarity. We observed
    that paraphrasing classifier gives the best result when trained first on an open-domain
    text and then on the healthcare domain. Our chatbot uses an ensemble of all three
    approaches. We observed that if a given q can be answered using the database,
    then our chatbot can provide at least one relevant QnA pair among its top three
    suggestions for up to 70% of the queries.

  title: Hindi Chatbot for Supporting Maternal and Child Health Related Queries in
    Rural India
- abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising direction for augmenting
    clinical diagnostic decision support and reducing diagnostic errors, a leading
    contributor to medical errors. To further the development of clinical AI systems,
    the Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmark (DR.BENCH) was introduced as a comprehensive
    generative AI framework, comprised of six tasks representing key components in
    clinical reasoning. We present a comparative analysis of in-domain versus out-of-domain
    language models as well as multi-task versus single task training with a focus
    on the problem summarization task in DR.BENCH. We demonstrate that a multi-task,
    clinically-trained language model outperforms its general domain counterpart by
    a large margin, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance, with a ROUGE-L
    score of 28.55. This research underscores the value of domain-specific training
    for optimizing clinical diagnostic reasoning tasks.

  title: Multi-Task Training with In-Domain Language Models for Diagnostic Reasoning
- abstract: Accurately capturing medication history is crucial in delivering high-quality
    medical care. The extraction of medication events from unstructured clinical notes,
    however, is challenging because the information is presented in complex narratives.
    We address this challenge by leveraging the newly released Contextualized Medication
    Event Dataset (CMED) as part of our participation in the 2022 National NLP Clinical
    Challenges (n2c2) shared task. Our study evaluates the performance of various
    pretrained language models in this task. Further, we find that data augmentation
    coupled with domain-specific training provides notable improvements. With experiments,
    we also underscore the importance of careful data preprocessing in medical event
    detection.

  title: Context-aware Medication Event Extraction from Unstructured Text
- abstract: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is the task of assigning
    a patient's electronic health records into standardized codes, which is crucial
    for enhancing medical services and reducing healthcare costs. In Korea, automatic
    Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD) coding has been hindered by limited
    resources, differences in ICD systems, and language-specific characteristics.
    Therefore, we construct the Korean Dataset for Automatic KCD coding (KoDAK) by
    collecting and preprocessing Korean clinical documents. In addition, we propose
    a tokenization method optimized for Korean clinical documents. Our experiments
    show that our proposed method outperforms Korean Medical BERT (KM-BERT) in Macro-F1
    performance by 0.14%p while using fewer model parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness
    in Korean clinical documents.

  title: 'Improving Automatic KCD Coding: Introducing the KoDAK and an Optimized Tokenization
    Method for Korean Clinical Documents'
- abstract: 'Natural language processing (NLP) has shown great potential for Alzheimer''s
    disease (AD) detection, particularly due to the adverse effect of AD on spontaneous
    speech. The current body of literature has directed attention toward context-based
    models, especially Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs),
    owing to their exceptional abilities to integrate contextual information in a
    wide range of NLP tasks.

    This comes at the cost of added model opacity and computational requirements.
    Taking this into consideration, we propose a Word2Vec-based model for AD detection
    in 108 age- and sex-matched participants who were asked to describe the Cookie
    Theft picture. We also investigate the effectiveness of our model by fine-tuning
    BERT-based sequence classification models, as well as incorporating linguistic
    features. Our results demonstrate that our lightweight and easy-to-implement model
    outperforms some of the state-of-the-art models available in the literature, as
    well as BERT models.'

  title: Who needs context? Classical techniques for Alzheimer’s disease detection
- abstract: 'In the medical field, there are many clinical texts such as electronic
    medical records, and research on Japanese natural language processing using these
    texts has been conducted.One such research involves Recognizing Textual Entailment
    (RTE) in clinical texts using a semantic analysis and logical inference system,
    ccg2lambda.However, it is difficult for existing inference systems to correctly
    determine the entailment relations , if the input sentence contains medical domain
    specific paraphrases such as disease names.

    In this study, we propose a method to supplement the equivalence relations of
    disease names as axioms by identifying candidates for paraphrases that lack in
    theorem proving.Candidates of paraphrases are identified by using a model for
    the NER task for disease names and a disease name dictionary.We also construct
    an inference test set that requires knowledge injection of disease names and evaluate
    our inference system.Experiments showed that our inference system was able to
    correctly infer for 106 out of 149 inference test sets.'

  title: Knowledge Injection for Disease Names in Logical Inference between Japanese
    Clinical Texts
- abstract: 'This work introduces a novel three-class annotation scheme for text-based
    dementia classification in patients, based on their recorded visit interactions.
    Multiple models were developed utilising BERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT. Two approaches
    were employed to improve the representation of dementia samples: oversampling
    the underrepresented data points in the original Pitt dataset and combining the
    Pitt with the Holland and Kempler datasets. The DistilBERT models trained on either
    an oversampled Pitt dataset or the combined dataset performed best in classifying
    the dementia class. Specifically, the model trained on the oversampled Pitt dataset
    and the one trained on the combined dataset obtained state-of-the-art performance
    with 98.8% overall accuracy and 98.6% macro-averaged F1-score, respectively. The
    models'' outputs were manually inspected through saliency highlighting, using
    Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), to provide a better understanding
    of its predictions.'

  title: Training Models on Oversampled Data and a Novel Multi-class Annotation Scheme
    for Dementia Detection
- abstract: Text in electronic health records is organized into sections, and classifying
    those sections into section categories is useful for downstream tasks. In this
    work, we attempt to improve the transferability of section classification models
    by combining the dataset-specific knowledge in supervised learning models with
    the world knowledge inside large language models (LLMs). Surprisingly, we find
    that zero-shot LLMs out-perform supervised BERT-based models applied to out-of-domain
    data. We also find that their strengths are synergistic, so that a simple ensemble
    technique leads to additional performance gains.

  title: Can Large Language Models Safely Address Patient Questions Following Cataract
    Surgery?
- abstract: We present our work on building large scale sequence-to-sequence models
    for generating clinical note from patient-doctor conversation. This is formulated
    as an abstractive summarization task for which we use encoder-decoder transformer
    model with pointer-generator. We discuss various modeling enhancements to this
    baseline model which include using subword and multiword tokenization scheme,
    prefixing the targets with a chain-of-clinical-facts, and training with contrastive
    loss that is defined over various candidate summaries. We also use flash attention
    during training and query chunked attention during inference to be able to process
    long input and output sequences and to improve computational efficiency. Experiments
    are conducted on a dataset containing about 900K encounters from around 1800 healthcare
    providers covering 27 specialties. The results are broken down into primary care
    and non-primary care specialties. Consistent accuracy improvements are observed
    across both of these categories.

  title: Large Scale Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Clinical Note Generation from
    Patient-Doctor Conversations
- abstract: 'Clinical Natural Language Processing has been an increasingly popular
    research area in the NLP community. With the rise of large language models (LLMs)
    and their impressive abilities in NLP tasks, it is crucial to pay attention to
    their clinical applications. Sequence to sequence generative approaches with LLMs
    have been widely used in recent years. To be a part of the research in clinical
    NLP with recent advances in the field, we participated in task A of MEDIQA-Chat
    at ACL-ClinicalNLP Workshop 2023. In this paper, we explain our methods and findings
    as well as our comments on our results and limitations. '

  title: 'clulab at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: Summarization and classification of medical
    dialogues'
- abstract: 'Early detection and automated classification of dementia has recently
    gained considerable attention using neuroimaging data and spontaneous speech.
    In this paper, we validate the possibility of dementia detection with in-hospital
    clinical notes. We collected 954 patients'' clinical notes from a local hospital
    and assign dementia/non-dementia labels to those patients based on clinical assessment
    and telephone interview. Given the labeled dementia data sets, we fine tune a
    ClinicalBioBERT based on some filtered clinical notes and conducted experiments
    on both binary and three class dementia classification. Our experiment results
    show that the fine tuned ClinicalBioBERT achieved satisfied performance on binary
    classification but failed on three class dementia classification. Further analysis
    suggests that more human prior knowledge should be considered. '

  title: Leveraging Natural Language Processing and Clinical Notes for Dementia Detection
- abstract: We propose a method to automate orthodontic diagnosis with natural language
    processing. It is worthwhile to assist dentists with such technology to prevent
    errors by inexperienced dentists and to reduce the workload of experienced ones.
    However, text length and style inconsistencies in medical findings make an automated
    orthodontic diagnosis with deep-learning models difficult. In this study, we improve
    the performance of automatic diagnosis utilizing short summaries of medical findings
    written in a consistent style by experienced dentists. Experimental results on
    970 Japanese medical findings show that summarization consistently improves the
    performance of various machine learning models for automated orthodontic diagnosis.
    Although BERT is the model that gains the most performance with the proposed method,
    the convolutional neural network achieved the best performance.

  title: Automated Orthodontic Diagnosis from a Summary of Medical Findings
- abstract: 'Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
    by large language models (LLMs), thereby revolutionizing the field. Our study
    investigates the impact of diverse pre-training strategies on the performance
    of Turkish clinical language models in a multi-label classification task involving
    radiology reports, with a focus on overcoming language resource limitations. Additionally,
    for the first time, we evaluated the simultaneous pre-training approach by utilizing
    limited clinical task data. We developed four models: TurkRadBERT-task v1, TurkRadBERT-task
    v2, TurkRadBERT-sim v1, and TurkRadBERT-sim v2. Our results revealed superior
    performance from BERTurk and TurkRadBERT-task v1, both of which leverage a broad
    general-domain corpus. Although task-adaptive pre-training is capable of identifying
    domain-specific patterns, it may be prone to overfitting because of the constraints
    of the task-specific corpus. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific
    vocabulary during pre-training to improve performance. They also affirmed that
    a combination of general domain knowledge and task-specific fine-tuning is crucial
    for optimal performance across various categories. This study offers key insights
    for future research on pre-training techniques in the clinical domain, particularly
    for low-resource languages.'

  title: 'Harnessing the Power of BERT in the Turkish Clinical Domain: Pretraining
    Approaches for Limited Data Scenarios'
- abstract: Over the last years, an increasing number of publicly available, semantically
    annotated medical corpora have been released for the German language. While their
    annotations cover comparable semantic classes, the synergies of such efforts have
    not been explored, yet. This is due to substantial differences in the data schemas
    (syntax) and annotated entities (semantics), which hinder the creation of common
    meta-datasets. For instance, it is unclear whether named entity recognition (NER)
    taggers trained on one or more of such datasets are useful to detect entities
    in any of the other datasets.  In this work, we create harmonized versions of
    German medical corpora using the BigBIO framework, and make them available to
    the community. Using these as a meta-dataset, we perform a series of cross-corpus
    evaluation experiments on two settings of aligned labels. These consist in fine-tuning
    various pre-trained Transformers on different combinations of training sets, and
    testing them against each dataset separately. We find that a) trained NER models
    generalize poorly, with F1 scores dropping approx. 20 pp. on unseen test data,
    and b) current pre-trained Transformer models for the German language do not systematically
    alleviate this issue. However, our results suggest that models benefit from additional
    training corpora in most cases, even if these belong to different medical fields
    or text genres.

  title: 'A Meta-dataset of German Medical Corpora: Harmonization of Annotations and
    Cross-corpus NER Evaluation'
- abstract: 'Post-stroke speech and language deficits (aphasia) significantly impact
    patients’ quality of life. Many with mild symptoms remain undiagnosed, and the
    majority do not receive the intensive doses of therapy recommended, due to healthcare
    costs and/or inadequate services. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) may help
    overcome these difficulties by improving diagnostic rates and providing feedback
    during tailored therapy. However, its performance is often unsatisfactory due
    to the high variability in speech errors and scarcity of training datasets. This
    study assessed the performance of Whisper, a recently released end-to-end model,
    in patients with post-stroke aphasia (PWA). We tuned its hyperparameters to achieve
    the lowest word error rate (WER) on aphasic speech. WER was significantly higher
    in PWA compared to age-matched controls (10.3% vs 38.5%, $p<0.001$). We demonstrated
    that worse WER was related to the more severe aphasia as measured by expressive
    (overt naming, and spontaneous speech production) and receptive (written and spoken
    comprehension) language assessments. Stroke lesion size did not affect the performance
    of Whisper. Linear mixed models accounting for demographic factors, therapy duration,
    and time since stroke, confirmed worse Whisper performance with left hemispheric
    frontal lesions.

    We discuss the implications of these findings for how future ASR can be improved
    in PWA.'

    We leverage existing annotations on the THYME dataset to semi-automatically construct

  title: Textual Entailment for Temporal Dependency Graph Parsing
- abstract: 'A medical provider''s summary of a patient visit serves several critical
    purposes, including clinical decision-making, facilitating hand-offs between providers,
    and as a reference for the patient. An effective summary is required to be coherent
    and accurately capture all the medically relevant information in the dialogue,
    despite the complexity of patient-generated language. Even minor inaccuracies
    in visit summaries (for example, summarizing "patient does not have a fever" when
    a fever is present) can be detrimental to the outcome of care for the patient.


    This paper tackles the problem of medical conversation summarization by discretizing
    the task into several smaller dialogue-understanding tasks that are sequentially
    built upon. First, we identify medical entities and their affirmations within
    the conversation to serve as building blocks. We study dynamically constructing
    few-shot prompts for tasks by conditioning on relevant patient information and
    use GPT-3 as the backbone for our experiments. We also develop GPT-derived summarization
    metrics to measure performance against reference summaries quantitatively. Both
    our human evaluation study and metrics for medical correctness show that summaries
    generated using this approach are clinically accurate and outperform the baseline
    approach of summarizing the dialog in a zero-shot, single-prompt setting.'

  title: 'Generating medically-accurate summaries of patient-provider dialogue: A
    multi-stage approach using large language models'
- abstract: 'Detecting duplicate patient participation in clinical trials is a major
    challenge because repeated patients can undermine the credibility and accuracy
    of the trial''s findings and result in significant health and financial risks.
    Developing accurate automated speaker verification (ASV) models is crucial to
    verify the identity of enrolled individuals and remove duplicates, but the size
    and quality of data influence ASV performance. However, there has been limited
    investigation into the factors that can affect ASV capabilities in clinical environments.
    In this paper, we bridge the gap by conducting analysis of how participant demographic
    characteristics, audio quality criteria, and severity level of Alzheimer''s disease
    (AD) impact the performance of ASV utilizing a dataset of speech recordings from
    659 participants with varying levels of AD, obtained through multiple speech tasks.
    Our results indicate that ASV performance: 1) is slightly better on male speakers
    than on female speakers; 2) degrades for individuals who are above 70 years old;
    3) is comparatively better for non-native English speakers than for native English
    speakers; 4) is negatively affected by clinician interference, noisy background,
    and unclear participant speech; 5) tends to decrease with an increase in the severity
    level of AD. Our study finds that voice biometrics raise fairness concerns as
    certain subgroups exhibit different ASV performances owing to their inherent voice
    characteristics. Moreover, the performance of ASV is influenced by the quality
    of speech recordings, which underscores the importance of improving the data collection
    settings in clinical trials.'

  title: Factors Affecting the Performance of Automated Speaker Verification in Alzheimer’s
    Disease Clinical Trials
- abstract: This paper describes Team Cadence's winning submission to Task C of the
    MEDIQA-Chat 2023 shared tasks. We also present the set of methods, including a
    novel N-pass strategy to summarize a mix of clinical dialogue and an incomplete
    summarized note, used to complete Task A and Task B, ranking highly on the leaderboard
    amongst stable and reproducible code submissions. The shared tasks invited participants
    to summarize, classify and generate patient-doctor conversations. Considering
    the small volume of training data available, we took a data-augmentation-first
    approach to the three tasks by focusing on the dialogue generation task, i.e.,
    Task C. It proved effective in improving our models' performance on Task A and
    Task B. We also found the BART architecture to be highly versatile, as it formed
    the base for all our submissions. Finally, based on the results shared by the
    organizers, we note that Team Cadence was the only team to submit stable and reproducible
    runs to all three tasks.

  title: 'Team Cadence at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: Generating, augmenting and summarizing
    clinical dialogue with large language models'
- abstract: 'Annotated clinical text corpora are essential for machine learning studies
    that model and predict care processes and disease progression. However, few studies
    describe the necessary experimental design of the annotation guideline and annotation
    phases. This makes replication, reuse, and adoption challenging.


    Using clinical questions about sepsis, we designed a semantic annotation guideline
    to capture sepsis signs from clinical text. The clinical questions aid guideline
    design, application, and evaluation. Our method incrementally evaluates each change
    in the guideline by testing the resulting annotated corpus using clinical questions.
    Additionally, our method uses inter-annotator agreement to judge the annotator
    compliance and quality of the guideline. We show that the method, combined with
    controlled design increments, is simple and allows the development and measurable
    improvement of a purpose-built semantic annotation guideline. We believe that
    our approach is useful for incremental design of semantic annotation guidelines
    in general.'

  title: Prompt Discriminative Language Models for Domain Adaptation
- abstract: Information extraction from clinical text has the potential to facilitate
    clinical research and personalized clinical care, but annotating large amounts
    of data for each set of target tasks is prohibitive. We present a German medical
    Named Entity Recognition (NER) system capable of cross-domain knowledge transferring.
    The system builds on a pre-trained German language model and a token-level binary
    classifier, employing semantic types sourced from the Unified Medical Language
    System (UMLS) as entity labels to identify corresponding entity spans within the
    input text. To enhance the system's performance and robustness, we pre-train it
    using a medical literature corpus that incorporates UMLS semantic term annotations.
    We evaluate the system's effectiveness on two German annotated datasets obtained
    from different clinics in zero- and few-shot settings. The results show that our
    approach outperforms task-specific Condition Random Fields (CRF) classifiers in
    terms of accuracy. Our work contributes to developing robust and transparent German
    medical NER models that can support the extraction of information from various
    clinical texts.

  title: Cross-domain German Medical Named Entity Recognition using a Pre-Trained
    Language Model and Unified Medical Semantic Types
- abstract: Graph-based techniques have gained traction for representing and analyzing
    data in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Knowledge graph-based
    language representation models have shown promising results in leveraging domain-specific
    knowledge for NLP tasks, particularly in the biomedical NLP field. However, such
    models have limitations, including knowledge noise and neglect of contextual relationships,
    leading to potential semantic errors and reduced accuracy. To address these issues,
    this paper proposes two novel methods. The first method combines knowledge graph-based
    language model with nearest-neighbor models to incorporate semantic and category
    information from neighboring instances. The second method involves integrating
    knowledge graph-based language model with graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage
    feature information from neighboring nodes in the graph. Experiments on relation
    extraction (RE) and classification tasks in English and Chinese language datasets
    demonstrate significant performance improvements with both methods, highlighting
    their potential for enhancing the performance of language models and improving
    NLP applications in the biomedical domain.

  title: Reducing Knowledge Noise for Improved Semantic Analysis in Biomedical Natural
    Language Processing Applications
- abstract: 'Artificial intelligence based diagnosis systems have emerged as powerful
    tools to reform traditional medical care. Each clinician now wants to have his
    own intelligent diagnostic partner to expand the range of services he can provide.  When
    reading a clinical note, experts make inferences with relevant knowledge. However,
    medical knowledge appears to be heterogeneous, including structured and unstructured
    knowledge. Existing approaches are incapable of uniforming them well. Besides,
    the descriptions of clinical findings in clinical notes, which are reasoned to
    diagnosis, vary a lot for different diseases or patients. To address these problems,
    we propose a Medical Knowledge-enhanced Prompt Learning (MedKPL) model for diagnosis
    classification. First, to overcome the heterogeneity of knowledge, given the knowledge
    relevant to diagnosis, MedKPL extracts and normalizes the relevant knowledge into
    a prompt sequence. Then, MedKPL integrates the knowledge prompt with the clinical
    note into a designed prompt for representation. Therefore, MedKPL can integrate
    medical knowledge into the models to enhance diagnosis and effectively transfer
    learned diagnosis capacity to unseen diseases using alternating relevant disease
    knowledge. The experimental results on two medical datasets show that our method
    can obtain better medical text classification results and can perform better in
    transfer and few-shot settings among datasets of different diseases. '

  title: Medical knowledge-enhanced prompt learning for diagnosis classification from
    clinical text
- abstract: Natural language tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the clinical
    domain on non-English texts can be very time-consuming and expensive due to the
    lack of annotated data. Cross-lingual transfer (CLT) is a way to circumvent this
    issue thanks to the ability of multilingual large language models to be fine-tuned
    on a specific task in one language and to provide high accuracy for the same task
    in another language. However, other methods leveraging translation models can
    be used to perform NER without annotated data in the target language, by either
    translating the training set or test set. This paper compares cross-lingual transfer
    with these two alternative methods, to perform clinical NER in French and in German
    without any training data in those languages. To this end, we release MedNERF
    a medical NER test set extracted from French drug prescriptions and annotated
    with the same guidelines as an English dataset. Through extensive experiments
    on this dataset and on a German medical dataset (Frei and Kramer, 2021), we show
    that translation-based methods can achieve similar performance to CLT but require
    more care in their design. And while they can take advantage of monolingual clinical
    language models, those do not guarantee better results than large general-purpose
    multilingual models, whether with cross-lingual transfer or translation.

  title: 'Multilingual Clinical NER: Translation or Cross-lingual Transfer?'
- abstract: 'Pre-trained transformer language models (LMs) have in recent years become
    the dominant paradigm in applied NLP. These models have achieved state-of-the-art
    performance on tasks such as information extraction, question answering, sentiment
    analysis, document classification and many others. In the biomedical domain, significant
    progress has been made in adapting this paradigm to NLP tasks that require the
    integration of domain-specific knowledge as well as statistical modelling of language.
    In particular, research in this area has focused on the question of how best to
    construct LMs that take into account not only the patterns of token distribution
    in medical text, but also the wealth of structured information contained in terminology
    resources such as the UMLS. This work contributes a data-centric paradigm for
    enriching the language representations of biomedical transformer-encoder LMs by
    extracting text sequences from the UMLS.

    This allows for graph-based learning objectives to be combined with masked-language
    pre-training. Preliminary results from experiments in the extension of pre-trained
    LMs as well as training from scratch show that this framework improves downstream
    performance on multiple biomedical and clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    tasks. All pre-trained models, data processing pipelines and evaluation scripts
    will be made publicly available.'

  title: 'WangLab at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: Clinical Note Generation from Doctor-Patient
    Conversations using Large Language Models'
- abstract: The disease coding task involves assigning a unique identifier from a
    controlled vocabulary to each disease mentioned in a clinical document. This task
    is relevant since it allows information extraction from unstructured data to perform,
    for example, epidemiological studies about the incidence and prevalence of diseases
    in a determined context. However, the manual coding process is subject to errors
    as it requires medical personnel to be competent in coding rules and terminology.
    In addition, this process consumes a lot of time and energy, which could be allocated
    to more clinically relevant tasks. These difficulties can be addressed by developing
    computational systems that automatically assign codes to diseases. In this way,
    we propose a two-step system for automatically coding diseases in referrals from
    the Chilean public healthcare system. Specifically, our model uses a state-of-the-art
    NER model for recognizing disease mentions and a search engine system based on
    Elasticsearch for assigning the most relevant codes associated with these disease
    mentions. The system's performance was evaluated on referrals manually coded by
    clinical experts. Our system obtained a MAP score of 0.63 for the subcategory
    level and 0.83 for the category level, close to the best-performing models in
    the literature. This system could be a support tool for health professionals,
    optimizing the coding and management process. Finally, to guarantee reproducibility,
    we publicly release the code of our models and experiments.

  title: 'Automatic Coding at Scale: Design and Deployment of a Nationwide System
    for Normalizing Referrals in the Chilean Public Healthcare System'
- abstract: 'This paper explores methods for extracting information from radiology
    reports that generalize across exam modalities to reduce requirements for annotated
    data. We demonstrate that multi-pass T5-based text-to-text generative models exhibit
    better generalization across exam modalities compared to approaches that employ
    BERT-based task-specific classification layers.  We then develop methods that
    reduce the inference cost of the model, making large-scale corpus processing more
    feasible for clinical applications. Specifically, we introduce a generative technique
    that decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtask blocks, which improves a single-pass
    model when combined with multitask training. In addition, we leverage target-domain
    contexts during inference to enhance domain adaptation, enabling use of smaller
    models. Analyses offer insights into the benefits of different cost reduction
    strategies. '

  title: 'Building blocks for complex tasks:  Robust generative event extraction for
    radiology reports under domain shifts'
- abstract: 'Detecting testimonial injustice is an essential element of addressing
    inequities and promoting inclusive healthcare practices, many of which are life-critical.
    However, using a single demographic factor to detect testimonial injustice does
    not fully encompass the nuanced identities that contribute to a patient''s experience.
    Further, some injustices may only be evident when examining the nuances that arise
    through the lens of intersectionality. Ignoring such injustices can result in
    poor quality of care or life-endangering events. Thus, considering intersectionality
    could result in more accurate classifications and just decisions. To illustrate
    this, we use real-world medical data to determine whether medical records exhibit
    words that could lead to testimonial injustice, employ fairness metrics (e.g.
    demographic parity, differential intersectional fairness, and subgroup fairness)
    to assess the severity to which subgroups are experiencing testimonial injustice,
    and analyze how the intersectionality of demographic features (e.g. gender and
    race) make a difference in uncovering testimonial injustice. From our analysis
    we found that with intersectionality we can better see disparities in how subgroups
    are treated and there are differences in how someone is treated based on the intersection
    of their demographic attributes. This has not been previously studied in clinical
    records, nor has it been proven through empirical study. '

  title: Intersectionality and Testimonial Injustice in Medical Records
- abstract: Motivated by the scarcity of high-quality labeled biomedical text, as
    well as the success of data programming, we introduce KRISS-Search. By leveraging
    the Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) ontology, KRISS-Search addresses an
    interactive few-shot span recommendation task that we propose. We first introduce
    unsupervised KRISS-Search and show that our method outperforms existing methods
    in identifying spans that are semantically similar to a given span of interest,
    with >50% AUPRC improvement relative to PubMedBERT. We then introduce supervised
    KRISS-Search, which leverages human interaction to improve the notion of similarity
    used by unsupervised KRISS-Search. Through simulated human feedback, we demonstrate
    an enhanced F1 score of 0.68 in classifying spans as semantically similar or different
    in the low-label setting, outperforming PubMedBERT by 2 F1 points. Finally, supervised
    KRISS-Search demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to PubMedBERT
    in few-shot biomedical named entity recognition (NER) across five benchmark datasets,
    with an average improvement of 5.6 F1 points. We envision KRISS-Search increasing
    the efficiency of programmatic data labeling and also providing broader utility
    as an interactive biomedical search engine.

  title: Interactive Span Recommendation for Biomedical Text
- abstract: 'Social determinants of health (SDOH) documented in the electronic health
    record through unstructured text are increasingly being studied to understand
    how SDOH impacts patient health outcomes. In this work, we utilize the Social
    History Annotation Corpus (SHAC), a multi-institutional corpus of de-identified
    social history sections annotated for SDOH, including substance use, employment,
    and living status information. We explore the automatic extraction of SDOH information
    with SHAC in both standoff and inline annotation formats using GPT-4 in a one-shot
    prompting setting. We compare GPT-4 extraction performance with a high-performing
    supervised approach and perform thorough error analyses. Our prompt-based GPT-4
    method achieved an overall 0.652 F1 on the SHAC test set, similar to the 7th best-performing
    system among all teams in the n2c2 challenge with SHAC. '

  title: Prompt-based Extraction of Social Determinants of Health Using Few-shot Learning
- abstract: In this paper, we introduce the design and various attempts for TaskB
    of MEDIQA-Chat 2023. The goal of TaskB in MEDIQA-Chat 2023 is to generate full
    clinical note from doctor-patient consultation dialogues. This task has several
    challenging issues, such as lack of training data, handling long dialogue inputs,
    and generating semi-structured clinical note which have section heads. To address
    these issues, we conducted various experiments and analyzed their results. We
    utilized the DialogLED model pre-trained on long dialogue data to handle long
    inputs, and we pre-trained on other dialogue datasets to address the lack of training
    data. We also attempted methods such as using prompts and contrastive learning
    for handling sections. This paper provides insights into clinical note generation
    through analyzing experimental methods and results, and it suggests future research
    directions.

  title: 'Teddysum at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: an analysis of fine-tuning strategy for long
    dialog summarization'
- abstract: Multi-label clinical text classification, such as automatic ICD coding,
    has always been a challenging subject in Natural Language Processing, due to its
    long, domain-specific documents and long-tail distribution over a large label
    set. Existing methods adopt different model architectures to encode the clinical
    notes. Whereas without digging out the useful connections between labels, the
    model presents a huge gap in predicting performances between rare and frequent
    codes. In this work, we propose a novel method for further mining the helpful
    relations between different codes via a relation-enhanced code encoder to improve
    the rare code performance. Starting from the simple code descriptions, the model
    reaches comparable, even better performances than models with heavy external knowledge.
    Our proposed method is evaluated on MIMIC-III, a common dataset in the medical
    domain. It outperforms the previous state-of-art models on both overall metrics
    and rare code performances. Moreover, the interpretation results further prove
    the effectiveness of our methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jiaminchen-1031/Rare-ICD.

  title: 'Rare Codes Count: Mining Inter-code Relations for Long-tail Clinical Text
    Classification'
- abstract: 'This paper presents the MEDIQA-Chat 2023 shared task organized at the
    ACL-Clinical NLP workshop. The shared task is motivated by the need to develop
    methods to automatically generate clinical notes from doctor-patient conversations.
    In this paper, we present our submission for \textit{MEDIQA-Chat 2023 Task A:
    Short Dialogue2Note Summarization}. Manual creation of these clinical notes requires
    extensive human efforts, thus making it a time-consuming and expensive process.
    To address this, we propose an ensemble-based method over GPT-3, BART, BERT variants,
    and Rule-based systems to automatically generate clinical notes from these conversations.
    The proposed system achieves a score of 0.730 and 0.544 for both the sub-tasks
    on the test set (ranking 8th on the leaderboard for both tasks) and shows better
    performance compared to a baseline system using BART variants. '

    Conversation with Transformers'
- abstract: Aphasia and dysarthria are both common symptoms of stroke, affecting around
    30% and 50% of acute ischemic stroke patients. In this paper, we propose a storyline-centric
    approach to detect aphasia and dysarthria in acute stroke patients using transcribed
    picture descriptions alone. Our pipeline enriches the training set with healthy
    data to address the lack of acute stroke patient data and utilizes knowledge distillation
    to significantly improve upon a document classification baseline, achieving an
    AUC of 0.814 (aphasia) and 0.764 (dysarthria) on a patient-only validation set.

  title: Storyline-Centric Detection of Aphasia and Dysarthria in Stroke Patient Transcripts
- abstract: The field of clinical natural language processing (NLP) can extract useful
    information from clinical text. Since 2017, the NLP field has shifted towards
    using pre-trained language models (PLMs), improving performance in several tasks.
    Most of the research in this field has focused on English text, but there are
    some available PLMs in Spanish. In this work, we use clinical PLMs to analyze
    text from admission and medical reports in Spanish for an insurance and health
    provider to give a probability of no coverage in a labor insurance process. Our
    results show that fine-tuning a PLM pre-trained with the provider's data leads
    to better results, but this process is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
    At least for this task, fine-tuning publicly available clinical PLM leads to comparable
    results to a custom PLM, but in less time and with fewer resources. Analyzing
    large volumes of insurance requests is burdensome for employers, and models can
    ease this task by pre-classifying reports that are likely not to have coverage.
    Our approach of entirely using clinical-related text improves the current models
    while reinforcing the idea of clinical support systems that simplify human labor
    but do not replace it. To our knowledge, the clinical corpus collected for this
    study is the largest one reported for the Spanish language.

  title: Pre-trained language models in Spanish for health insurance coverage
- abstract: 'In response to the global challenge of mental health problems, we proposes
    a Logical Neural Network (LNN) based Neuro-Symbolic AI method for the diagnosis
    of mental disorders. Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental
    disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with
    the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and
    may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network architecture
    that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning
    capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system uses input predicates
    from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder class, and different predicate
    pruning techniques are used to achieve scalability and higher scores. In addition,
    we provide an insight extraction method to aid therapists with their diagnosis.
    The proposed system addresses the lack of explainability of current Neural Network
    models and provides a more trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.

  title: 'Utterance Classification with Logical Neural Network: Explainable AI for
    Mental Disorder Diagnosis'
- abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a sub-task of  Natural Language Generation
    (NLG) and aims to present information from various sources in textual form and
    synthesize salient information, with the goal of reducing the time spent by domain
    experts in writing medical reports and providing support information for decision-making.
    Given the specificity of the medical domain, the evaluation of automatically generated
    medical reports is of paramount importance to the validity of these systems. Therefore,
    in this paper, we focus on the evaluation of automatically generated medical reports
    from the perspective of automatic and human evaluation. We present evaluation
    methods for general NLG evaluation and how they have been applied to domain-specific
    medical tasks. The study shows that MRG evaluation methods are very diverse, and
    that further work is needed to build shared evaluation methods. The state of the
    art also emphasizes that such an evaluation must be task specific and include
    human assessments, requesting the participation of experts in the field.

  title: A Survey of Evaluation Methods of Generated Medical Textual Reports
- abstract: This paper presents UMASS_BioNLP team participation in the MEDIQA-Chat
    2023 shared task for Task-A and Task-C. We focus especially on Task-C and propose
    a novel LLMs cooperation system named a doctor-patient loop to generate high-quality
    conversation data sets. The experiment results demonstrate that our approaches
    yield reasonable performance as evaluated by automatic metrics such as ROUGE,
    medical concept recall, BLEU, and Self-BLEU.  Furthermore, we conducted a comparative
    analysis between our proposed method and ChatGPT and GPT-4. This analysis also
    investigates the potential of utilizing cooperation LLMs to generate high-quality
    datasets.

  title: 'UMASS_BioNLP at MEDIQA-Chat 2023:   Can LLMs generate high-quality synthetic
    note-oriented doctor-patient conversations?'
- abstract: In recent years, we have seen many Transformer based models being created
    to address Dialog Summarization problem. While there has been a lot of work on
    understanding how these models stack against each other in summarizing regular
    conversations such as the ones found in DialogSum dataset, there haven't been
    many analysis of these models on Clinical Dialog Summarization. In this article,
    we describe our solution to MEDIQA-Chat 2023 Shared Tasks as part of ACL-ClinicalNLP
    2023 workshop which benchmarks some of the popular Transformer Architectures such
    as BioBart, Flan-T5, DialogLED, and OpenAI GPT3 on the problem of Clinical Dialog
    Summarization. We analyse their performance on two tasks - summarizing short conversations
    and long conversations. In addition to this, we also benchmark two popular summarization
    ensemble methods and report their performance.

  title: 'HealthMavericks@MEDIQA-Chat 2023: Benchmarking different Transformer based
    models for Clinical Dialogue Summarization'
- abstract: 'Medical dialogue summarization is challenging due to the unstructured
    nature of medical conversations, the use of medical terminology

    in gold summaries, and the need to identify key information across multiple symptom
    sets. We present a novel system for the Dialogue2Note Medical Summarization tasks
    in the MEDIQA 2023 Shared Task. Our approach for sectionwise summarization (Task
    A) is a two-stage process of selecting semantically similar dialogues and using
    the top-k similar dialogues as in-context examples for GPT-4. For full-note summarization
    (Task B), we use a similar solution with k=1. We achieved 3rd place in Task A
    (2nd among all teams), 4th place in Task B Division Wise Summarization (2nd among
    all teams), 15th place in Task A Section Header Classification (9th among all
    teams), and 8th place among all teams in Task B. Our results highlight the effectiveness
    of few-shot prompting for this task, though we also identify several weaknesses
    of prompting-based approaches. We compare GPT-4 performance with several finetuned
    baselines. We find that GPT-4 summaries are more abstractive and shorter. We make
    our code publicly available.'

  title: Overview of the MEDIQA-Chat 2023 Shared Tasks on the Summarization & Generation
    of Doctor-Patient Conversations
- abstract: We propose a transfer learning method that adapts a high-resource English
    clinical NER model to low-resource languages and domains using only small amounts
    of in-domain annotated data. Our approach involves translating in-domain datasets
    to English, fine-tuning the English model on the translated data, and then transferring
    it to the target language/domain. Experiments on Spanish, French, and conversational
    clinical text datasets show accuracy gains over models trained on target data
    alone. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can enable clinical
    NLP in more languages and modalities with limited resources.

  title: Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Clinical Named Entity Recognition
- abstract: Clinical conversation summarization has become an important application
    of Natural language Processing. In this work, we intend to analyze summarization
    model ensembling approaches, that can be utilized to improve the overall accuracy
    of the generated medical report called chart note. The work starts with a single
    summarization model creating the baseline. Then leads to an ensemble of summarization
    models trained on a separate section of the chart note. This leads to the final
    approach of passing the generated results to another summarization model in a
    multi-layer/stage fashion for better coherency of the generated text. Our results
    indicate that although an ensemble of models specialized in each section produces
    better results, the multi-layer/stage approach does not improve accuracy. The

  title: 'Care4Lang at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: Fine-tuning Language Models for Classifying
    and Summarizing Clinical Dialogues'
- abstract: This paper presents our system for the MEDIQA-Chat 2023 shared task on
    medical conversation summarization. Our approach involves finetuning a LongT5
    model on multiple tasks simultaneously, which we demonstrate improves the model's
    overall performance while reducing the number of factual errors and hallucinations
    in the generated summary. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of augmenting
    the data with in-text annotations from a clinical named entity recognition model,
    finding that this approach decreased summarization quality. Lastly, we explore
    using different text generation strategies for medical note generation based on
    the length of the note. Our findings suggest that the application of our proposed
    approach can be beneficial for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of medical
    conversation summarization.

    (DS4DH) group in the MEDIQA-Chat Tasks at ACL-ClinicalNLP 2023. Our study combines
    the power of a classical machine learning method, Support Vector Machine, for
    classifying medical dialogues, along with the implementation of one-shot prompts
    using GPT-3.5. We employ dialogues and summaries from the same category as prompts
    to generate summaries for novel dialogues. Our findings exceed the average benchmark
    score, offering a robust reference for assessing performance in this field.

- abstract: 'This paper presents our contribution to the MEDIQA-2023 Dialogue2Note
    shared task, encompassing both subtask A and subtask B. We approach the task as
    a dialogue summarization problem and implement two distinct pipelines: (a) a fine-tuning
    of a pre-trained dialogue summarization model and GPT-3, and (b) few-shot in-context
    learning (ICL) using a large language model, GPT-4. Both methods achieve excellent
    results in terms of ROUGE-1 F1, BERTScore F1 (deberta-xlarge-mnli), and BLEURT,
    with scores of 0.4011, 0.7058, and 0.5421, respectively. Additionally, we predict
    the associated section headers using RoBERTa and SciBERT based classification
    models. Our team ranked fourth among all teams, while each team is allowed to
    submit three runs as part of their submission. We also utilize expert annotations
    to demonstrate that the notes generated through the ICL GPT-4 are better than
    all other baselines. The code for our submission is available.'
