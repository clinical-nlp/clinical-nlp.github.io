    - title: Keynote
      speaker: Dr. Karandeep Singh
      abstract: "In this talk, Dr. Karandeep Singh will describe healthcare delivery challenges that cut across multiple clinical services and care settings and culminate in the phenomenon of patients 'boarding' in the emergency department. Is boarding really a fixable problem? If so, how can artificial intelligence (AI) help? He will present key areas where AI can play a role in informing and redesigning how care is delivered, touching on its roles in measurement, simulation, prediction, and automation. The talk is intended to build skills in health systems-level thinking and AI-supported quality improvement."
