- abstract: Extracting patient treatment timelines from clinical notes is a complex
    task involving identification of relevant events, temporal expressions, and temporal
    relations in individual documents and developing cross-document summaries. The
    2025 Shared Task on Chemotherapy Treatment Timeline Extraction builds upon the
    initial 2024 challenge, using data from 57,530 breast and ovarian cancer patients
    and 15,946 melanoma patients. Participants were provided with a subset annotated
    for treatment entities, temporal expressions, temporal relations, and timelines
    for each patient. This training data was used to addressed two subtasks. Subtask
    1 focused on extracting temporal relations and creating timelines, given documents
    and gold-standard events and temporal expressions. Sutask 2 involved development
    of an end-to-end system involving extraction of entities, temporal expressions,
    and relations, and construction of timelines, given only the Electronic Health
    Record notes. Five teams participated, submitting eight entries for Subtask 1
    and twelve for Subtask 2. Supervised fine-tuning remains a productive approach
    albeit with a shift of supervised fine-tuning of very large language models compared
    to the 2024 task edition.  Even with the much more "strict" evaluation metric,
    the best results are comparable to the  best less strict 2024 relaxed-to-month
    results.

  title: Overview of the 2025 Shared Task on Chemotherapy Treatment Timeline Extraction
- abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
    over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
    MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to generate
    free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and patient queries.
    We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a general-domain, instruction-tuned
    large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that
    incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds
    outputs in clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence,
    and response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
    best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an average
    score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs—a
    minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant exemplars via simple indexing
    and fusion, with no extra training or complex re-ranking— provides a simple and
    effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks.

  title: 'MasonNLP at MEDIQA-WV 2025: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation with
    Large Language Models for Medical VQA'
- abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
    information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
    such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse
    sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn
    doctor–patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory
    tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task
    focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts,
    requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance.
    We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams
    with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned
    LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context
    example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with
    notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate
    that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
    can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

  title: 'MasonNLP at MEDIQA-OE 2025: Assessing Large Language Models for Structured
    Medical Order Extraction'
- abstract: 'The accurate extraction of medical orders from

    doctor-patient conversations is a critical task

    for reducing clinical documentation burdens

    and ensuring patient safety. This paper details

    our team''s submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025

    Shared Task. We investigate the performance

    of MedGemma, a new domain-specific opensource language model, for structured order
    extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward

    one-shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct

    framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow.

    Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic
    flows

    are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting

    method achieved the highest performance on

    the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts,
    complex reasoning

    chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach
    more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable

    insights into selecting appropriate prompting

    strategies for clinical information extraction in

    varied data conditions.'

  title: 'EXL Health AI Lab at MEDIQA-OE 2025: Evaluating Prompting Strategies with
    MedGemma for Medical Order Extraction'
- abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider
    workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing
    patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this
    challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries
    paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed
    for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training
    data is embedded, and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as
    few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata
    ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance
    response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases
    and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs
    based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting
    improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines
    clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for
    developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care
    support.

    Generation for Wound Care Visual Question Answering'
- abstract: 'Medical order extraction from doctor-patient conversations presents a
    critical challenge in reducing clinical documentation burden and ensuring accurate
    capture of patient care instructions. This paper describes our system for the
    MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task using the ACI-Bench and PriMock57 datasets, which achieved

    four metrics: description ROUGE-1 F1, reason ROUGE-1 F1, order-type strict F1,
    and provenance multi-label F1. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuned
    biomedical language models, we demonstrate that a carefully engineered zero-shot
    prompting strategy using Gemini 2.5 Pro can achieve competitive performance without
    requiring model training or GPU resources. Our approach employs a deterministic
    state-machine prompt design incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning, self-verification
    protocols, and structured JSON output generation. The system particularly excels
    in reason extraction, achieving 0.4130 ROUGE-1 F1, the highest among the top performing
    teams. Our results suggest that advanced prompt engineering can effectively bridge
    the gap between general-purpose large language models and specialized clinical

    Order Extraction'
- abstract: Extracting chemotherapy timelines from clinical narratives is a challenging
    task, but critical for cancer research and practice. In this paper, we present
    our approach and the research investigation we conducted to participate in Subtask
    1 of the ChemoTimelines 2025 shared task on predicting temporal relations between
    pre-identified events and time expressions. We evaluated multiple fine-tuned large
    language models for the task. We used supervised fine-tuning strategies for Llama3-8B
    model to classify temporal relations. Further, we set up zero-shot prompting for
    Qwen3-14B to normalize time expressions. We also pre-trained and fine-tuned a
    Llama3-3B model using unlabeled notes and achieved results comparable with the
    fine-tuned Llama3-8B model. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning
    and continual pre-training strategies in adapting large language models to domain-specific
    tasks.

  title: 'TEAM UAB at Chemotherapy Timelines 2025: Integrating Encoders and Large
    Language Models for Chemotherapy Timelines Generation'
- abstract: The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines
    of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients.
    This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2---generating
    patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies
    involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference
    optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All
    of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted
    chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized
    and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed
    in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded

  title: 'UW-BioNLP at ChemoTimelines 2025: Thinking, Fine-Tuning, and Dictionary-Enhanced
    LLM Systems for Chemotherapy Timeline Extraction'
- abstract: Clinical documentation increasingly uses automatic speech recognition
    and summarization, yet converting conversations into actionable medical orders
    for Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can
    significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact
    downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first
    challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six
    teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of approaches,
    and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In this paper,
    we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking, and participants’
    solutions.

  title: Overview of the MEDIQA-OE 2025 Shared Task on Medical Order Extraction from
    Doctor-Patient Consultations
- abstract: Electronic messaging through patient portals facilitates remote care,
    connecting patients with doctors through asynchronous communication. While convenient,
    this new modality places an additional burden on physicians, requiring them to
    provide remote care as well as to see patients in clinic. Technology that can
    automatically draft responses for physician review is a promising way to improve
    clinical efficiency. Here, building on the 2024 MEDIQA Multilingual Multi-modal
    Medical Answer Generation (MEDIQA-M3G) challenge on dermatology, we present the
    2025 MEDIQA Woundcare Visual Question Answering (MEDIQA-WV) shared task focusing
    on generating clinical responses to patient text and image queries. Three teams
    participated and submitted a total of fourteen systems. In this paper, we describe
    the task, datasets, as well as the participating systems and their results. We
    hope that this work can inspire future research on wound care visual question
    answering.
