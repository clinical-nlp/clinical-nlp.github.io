			We are following the EMNLP policy, which allows one (1) extra page to address reviewers' comments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Poster and oral presentations will both be in the proceedings. 
		 	Oral presentations will be presented in a single track, and posters will be presented simultaneously using gather.town.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following EMNLP guidance, each paper must be pre-recorded, so that participants in different time zones can listen to your talks at a time that is reasonable for them.
			Pre-recording will be done using the SlidesLive remote recorder, and SlidesLive will contact authors about pre-recording.
			Pre-recorded talks must be submitted by <b>Oct 26, 2020</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
	      		Pre-recorded talk times for Clinical NLP are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>10 minutes for oral presentations of long papers</li>
				<li>5 minutes for oral presentations of short papers</li>
				<li>1 minute for a teaser of each poster presentation</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	      	<p>
			FROM EMNLP (please see email for further details): 
			Your pre-recorded talk will also be AUTOMATICALLY CAPTIONED.
			Accurate captioning is critical, not just for people attending the conference who are hearing-impaired, but also for people who may not have native competency in English.
			
			The problem is that automated captioning is often inaccurate.
			So it is important that all captions be manually reviewed and, where necessary, corrected.
			For this, SlidesLive has developed caption-editing software for people to use.
