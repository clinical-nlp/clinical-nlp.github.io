### Call for Papers & Participation: The ACL-ClinicalNLP Workshop & Shared Tasks 2023

Clinical text is growing rapidly as electronic health records become pervasive.
Much of the information recorded in a clinical encounter is located exclusively in provider narrative notes, which makes them indispensable for supplementing structured clinical data in order to better understand patient state and care provided.
The methods and tools developed for the clinical domain have historically lagged behind the scientific advances in the general-domain NLP.
Despite the substantial recent strides in clinical NLP, a substantial gap remains.
The goal of this workshop is to address this gap by establishing a regular event in CL conferences that brings together researchers interested in developing state-of-the-art methods for the clinical domain.
The focus is on improving NLP technology to enable clinical applications, and specifically, information extraction and modeling of narrative provider notes from electronic health records, patient encounter transcripts, and other clinical narratives.

Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
* Modeling clinical text in standard NLP tasks (tagging, chunking, parsing, entity identification, entity linking/normalization, relation extraction, coreference, summarization, etc.)
* De-identification and other handling of protected health information
* Structure of clinical documents (e.g., section identification)
* Information extraction from clinical text
* Integration of structured and textual data for clinical tasks
* Domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques for clinical data
* Generation of clinical notes: summarization, image-to-text, generation of notes from clinical conversations, etc.
* Annotation schemes and annotation methodology for clinical data
* Evaluation techniques for the clinical domain
* Bias and fairness in clinical text

In 2023, Clinical NLP will encourage submissions from four special tracks:
* Clinical NLP in languages other than English
* Clinical NLP in low-resource settings
* Clinical NLP for clinical conversations (e.g., doctor-patient)
* Multi-word expressions in Clinical NLP, a joint track with [MWE 2023](https://multiword.org/mwe2023/)

The 5th Clinical NLP Workshop will be co-located with [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org/) in Toronto, Canada - July 13 or 14, 2023. 

## Shared Task

Clinical NLP 2023 is hosting the [MEDIQA-Chat Shared Tasks](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2023/clinicalnlp-mediqa-chat-2023) on doctor-patient conversations, which focuses on the following tasks:

1. Dialogue2Note Summarization: Given a conversation between a doctor and patient, participants are tasked with producing a clinical note summarizing the conversation with one or multiple note sections (e.g. Assessment, Past Medical History, Past Surgical History). 
2. Note2Dialogue Generation: Given a clinical note, participants are tasked with generating a synthetic doctor-patient conversation related to the information described in the clinical note section(s). 

Please visit the [shared task website](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2023/clinicalnlp-mediqa-chat-2023) to register to participate and for additional information about the shared tasks.

## Submissions

Submissions may have a maximum length of eight (8) pages for long papers and four (4) pages for short papers and shared task participant papers, with unlimited pages for references and appendices.
All submissions must be made through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/) and follow [ACL formatting guidelines](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html).
The OpenReview submission site will be found here:

https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2023/Workshop/Clinical_NLP

We encourage submissions of papers submitted but not accepted by [EACL 2023](https://2023.eacl.org/), [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org/), or [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/), as long as the topics are relevant to Clinical NLP.
