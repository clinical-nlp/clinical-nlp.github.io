## Submissions

All submissions must be made through [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/) and follow [ACL Rolling Review style guidelines](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).
Submissions may have a maximum length of eight (8) pages for long papers and four (4) pages for short papers, with unlimited pages for references and appendices.

To be considered for Clinical NLP 2022, you must have your reviews back from ACL Rolling Review by 20 Apr 2022 , meaning the last date to submit to ACL Rolling Review would be 15 Mar 2022.
If you submitted your reviews to NAACL 2022, and you find you are not accepted by NAACL on 7 Apr 2022, you may submit the same reviews to Clinical NLP 2022 if the topic is appropriate to the workshop.
