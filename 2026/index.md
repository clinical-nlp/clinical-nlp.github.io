### Shared Tasks

- [**MEDIQA-EVAL: Evaluating Metrics for Multimodal Question Answering**](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2026/mediqa-eval):
  In this multimodal evaluation task, participants assign quality scores to model-generated answers for patient questions that are paired with one or multiple clinical images. The dataset includes both English and Chinese questions and answers, along with structured metadata such as anatomical location and wound type. Each system answer is independently rated by clinical experts along three dimensions: overall quality, factual accuracy, and completeness.

- [**MEDIQA-SYNUR: Extracting Clinical Observations from Nurse Dictations**](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2026/mediqa-synur):
  This shared task focuses on extracting and normalizing clinical observations from conversational transcripts and mapping them to a large ontology of clinical concepts. Participants will be evaluated on a curated and validated benchmark of nurse dictations generated through a controlled multi-agent simulation pipeline. Gold-standard annotations were produced by expert nurses using an open-source, large-scale clinical ontology.
