### Submissions

The OpenReview submission site is:

* <https://openreview.net/group?id=clinical-nlp.github.io/Clinical_NLP/2025/Workshop>

All submissions must follow [ACL formatting guidelines](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html), including:

* Submissions should be anonymous and [must not include any identifying information about the authors](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/review-version.html)
* Papers may have up to eight (8) pages of content.
* You are allowed [unlimited pages for references](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html#paper-length).
Any “Limitations” section or “Ethics Statement” is similar to references; it does not count toward the page limit.

Clinical NLP 2025 has no preprint restrictions; you may post to arXiv at any time. We expect Clinical NLP 2025 workshop proceedings to be archival and are working to get them published [on the ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/venues/clinicalnlp/).
